<h2><a name="MYSTERY_NO_I" id="MYSTERY_NO_I"></a>MYSTERY NO. I</h2>

<h3>SHIN SHIRA APPEARS</h3>


<p>It was very remarkable how I first came to
make his acquaintance at all. Shin Shira I mean.
I had been sitting at my desk, writing, for quite
a long time, when suddenly I heard, as I thought,
a noise in another part of the room. I turned
my head hastily and looked towards the door,
but it was fast closed and there was apparently
nobody in the room but myself.</p>

<p>"Strange!" I murmured, looking about to
try and discover what had caused the sound, and
then my eyes lighted, to my great surprise, upon
a pair of bright yellow morocco shoes with very
long, pointed toes, standing on the floor in front
of a favourite little squat chair of mine which I
call "the Toad."</p>

<p>I gazed at the yellow shoes in amazement, for
they certainly did not belong to me, and they had
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>decidedly not been there a short time before, for
I had been sitting in the chair myself.</p>

<p>I had just got up to examine them, when, to
my utter astonishment, I saw a pair of yellow
stockings appearing above them; an instant
later, a little yellow body; and finally, the quaintest
little head that I have ever seen, surmounted
by a yellow turban, in the front of which a large
jewel sparkled and shone.</p>

<p>It was not the turban, however, but the face
beneath it which claimed my greatest attention,
for the eyes were nearly starting out of the head
with fright, and the expression was one of the
greatest anxiety.</p>

<p>It gave way, however, to reassurance and content
directly the little man had given a hurried
glance round the room, and he sank comfortably
down into "the Toad" with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Phew!" he exclaimed, drawing out a little
yellow fan from his sleeve and fanning himself
vigorously, "that <i>was</i> a narrow squeak! I
really don't think that I've been in such a tight
corner before for two hundred years at least."
And he tucked his fan away again and beamed
upon me complacently.</p>

<p>I was so astounded at the sudden appearance
of this remarkable little personage that for the
moment I quite lost the use of my tongue; and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>in the meantime my little visitor was glancing
about the room with piercing eyes that seemed
to take in everything.</p>

<p>"H'm!&mdash;writer, I suppose?" he said, nodding
his head towards my desk, which was as usual
littered with papers. "What line? You don't
look very clever," and he glanced at me critically
from under his bushy eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I only write books for children," I answered,
"and one doesn't have to be very clever to do
that."</p>

<p>"Oh, children!" said the little Yellow Dwarf&mdash;as
I had begun to call him in my own mind.
"No, you don't have to be <i>clever</i>, but you have
to be&mdash;er&mdash;by the way, do you write fairy
stories?" he interrupted himself to ask.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," I answered.</p>

<p>"Ah! then I can put you up to a thing or
two. I'm partly a fairy myself.</p>

<p>"You see, it's this way," he went on hastily,
seeing, I suppose, that I looked somewhat surprised
at this unexpected piece of information.
"Some hundreds of years ago&mdash;oh! ever so many&mdash;long
before the present Japanese Empire was
founded, in fact, there was a man named Shin
Shira Scaramanga Manousa Yama Hawa&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt," said the little Yellow
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>Dwarf, "it's rude, and besides, you make me
forget&mdash;I can't even think now what the rest of
the gentleman's name was&mdash;but anyhow, he was
an ancestor of mine, and that much of his name
belongs to me."</p>

<p>"How much?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Shin Shira Scaramanga Manousa Yama
Hawa," repeated the Yellow Dwarf; "but you
needn't say it all," he added hastily, seeing, I
suppose, that I looked rather distressed, "Shin
Shira will do; in fact, that's what I am always
called. Well, to continue. This ancestor of
mine, part of whose name I bear, did something
or other to offend his great-grandmother, who was
a very influential sort of a fairy&mdash;I <i>could</i> tell you
the whole story, but it's a very long one and I'll
have to tell you that another time&mdash;and she was
so angry with him that she condemned him to
appear or disappear whenever she liked and at
whatever time or place that she chose, for ever."</p>

<p>"For ever?" I inquired incredulously.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Shin Shira. "Fairies, you
know, are immortal, and my ancestor had fairy
blood in his veins. Well, to make a long story
short, the spell, or whatever you choose to call it,
which his great-grandmother cast over him,
didn't work in him, nor in his son, nor even in his
grandson; but several hundreds of years afterwards<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
<i>I</i> was born, and then it suddenly took
effect, and I have always been afflicted with the
exceedingly uncomfortable misfortune of having
to appear or disappear whenever the old lady
likes, and in whatever place she chooses.</p>

<p>"It's terribly awkward at times, for one
minute I may be in China taking tea with a
Mandarin of the Blue Button, and have to disappear
suddenly, turning up a minute later in
a first-class carriage on the Underground Railway,
greatly to the surprise and indignation of the
passengers, especially if it happens to be overcrowded
without me, as it very often is.</p>

<p>"Not but what it has its advantages too," he
added thoughtfully, "and this very power of
being able to disappear suddenly has just got
me out of a most serious dilemma."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me about it?" I inquired
with considerable curiosity, for I was beginning
to be very interested in this singular little person's
account of himself.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said Shin Shira; and settling
himself more comfortably in "the Toad," resting
his elbows on the arms of the chair, and placing
the tips of his fingers together, he told me the
following story.</p>

<p>"The very last place in which I appeared
before turning up here, was in the grounds of
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>the Palace belonging to the Grand Panjandrum&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is that situated, if you please?" I
ventured to inquire.</p>

<p>Shin Shira gave me a quick glance.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that you actually don't
even know where the land of the Grand Panjandrum
is?" he asked. "H'm! well," he
continued as I shook my head, "I remarked a
short time ago that you didn't <i>look</i> very clever,
but really, I couldn't have believed that you were
so ignorant as all that. You'd better look it
up in your atlas when I am gone, I can't bother
to explain where it is now&mdash;but to resume my
story. I appeared there, as I said, and in the
middle of the kitchen garden all amongst the
cabbages and beans.</p>

<p>"I could at first see nobody about, but at last
I heard somebody singing, and presently came
upon a man carrying a basket in which were some
cabbages that he had evidently just gathered.</p>

<p>"Although he was singing so cheerfully, his
head was bound up with a handkerchief, and I
could see that his face was badly swollen.</p>

<p>"When he had come a little nearer, I bowed
politely and inquired of him what place it was,
for my surroundings were quite strange to me,
it being my first visit to the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 15]<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>"He told me where I was, and explained that
he was the Grand Panjandrum's Chief Cook, and
that he had been to gather cabbages to make an
apple pie with."</p>

<p>I was about to ask how this was possible, when
I caught Shin Shira's eye, and I could see by the
light in it that he was expecting me to make
some inquiry; but I was determined that he should
not again have the opportunity of remarking
upon my ignorance, so I held my tongue and said
nothing, as though gathering cabbages in order
to make an apple pie was the most natural thing
in the world to do.</p>

<p>He waited for a moment and then continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"I stood talking to the man for some time,
and at last I asked what was the matter with his
face.</p>

<p>"'I've the toothache,' he said ruefully, 'and
that's why I was singing; I'm told that it's a
capital remedy.'</p>

<p>"'I'll see if I can't find a better one,' said I,
taking up this little book, which I always carry
with me." And Shin Shira held out for my
inspection a tiny volume bound in yellow leather,
with golden clasps, which was attached to his
girdle by a long golden chain.</p>

<p>"This," he explained, "is a very remarkable
book, and has been in our family for many
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 16]<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>hundreds of years. It contains directions what
to do in any difficulty whatsoever, with the aid
of the fairy power, which, as I have told you, I
inherit from my fairy ancestor.</p>

<p>"The only difficulty is that, as I am partly a
mortal, <i>sometimes</i> (owing perhaps to my fairy
great-great-great-grandmother being in a bad
temper at the moment) the fairy spell refuses
to work, and then I am left in the lurch.</p>

<p>"This time, however, it worked splendidly, for
I had only to turn to the word 'Toothache'
to discover that the fairy remedy was to 'rub the
<i>other</i> side of the face with a stinging nettle, and
the pain and swelling would instantly disappear.'</p>

<p>"Fortunately there were plenty of nettles to
be found in a neglected corner of the garden, and
I quickly applied the remedy, which worked, as
the saying is, 'like magic,' for the Grand Panjandrum's
Chief Cook's face resumed its normal size
at once, and the pain vanished immediately.</p>

<p>"It is needless to say that he was very grateful,
and we were walking back to the Palace, where
he had just promised to regale me with some of
the choicest viands in his larder, when we met,
coming towards us, a most doleful-looking individual,
clothed in black and wearing a most woebegone
visage.</p>

<p>"'It's the Court Physician,' said the Cook; 'I
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 17]<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>wonder why he is looking so melancholy. May I
venture to ask, sir,' he inquired respectfully, 'the
occasion of your sorrow?'</p>

<p>"'I am to be executed to-morrow by the
Grand Panjandrum's order,' said the Court
Physician dolefully, wiping a tear of self-pity from
his eye.</p>

<p>"The Chief Cook shrugged his shoulders.
'H'm!' said he, 'if <i>that's</i> the case, and His
Supreme Importance has ordered your execution,
nobody can possibly prevent it, and there is
nothing left but to grin and bear it.'</p>

<p>"'No,' said the Court Physician indignantly.
'I may have to bear it, but I shall <i>not</i> grin. I
absolutely refuse! They can't do more than kill
me, and I <i>won't</i> grin, so there!'</p>

<p>"The Chief Cook looked horrified. 'It's one
of the laws of the land,' he said, 'that whenever
one suffers anything at the hands of the Grand
Panjandrum, one must grin and bear it; it's a
most terrible offence not to do so.'</p>

<p>"'I don't care,' said the Court Physician
recklessly, 'I shan't grin, and there's an end
of it.'</p>

<p>"'Why are you sentenced to death?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'His Supreme Importance, the Grand Panjandrum,
has had the toothache for three days,
and I have been unable to subdue it without
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 18]<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>drawing the tooth, which His Supreme Importance
refuses to permit me to do, and in a fit of
temper yesterday he said that if he were not
better to-day I should be executed to-morrow&mdash;and
it's worse.'</p>

<p>"The Chief Cook looked at me delightedly.</p>

<p>"'If <i>that's</i> all,' he said, 'this gentleman, whose
name I am unfortunately unacquainted with, has
a remedy which will soon get you out of your
trouble, and I shouldn't wonder if, after all, His
Supreme Importance's toothache were the means
of raising us all to honour and distinction;' and
he proceeded to tell the Court Physician how
I had been successful in ridding <i>him</i> of the
toothache.</p>

<p>"The Court Physician was greatly interested,
and after I had read to him the directions in the
book, he suggested that he should take me to
the Palace at once and into the presence of
the Grand Panjandrum.</p>

<p>"'For no doubt the operation must be performed
by yourself, since you alone possess the
fairy power,' said he. And so we made the best
of our way to the beautiful building which I could
see in the distance.</p>

<p>"I wish I could describe to you the magnificence
of that marvellous place. The jewelled
windows and golden staircase; the wonderful
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 19]<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>velvety carpets and silken hangings; the hundreds
of silent servants dressed in the beautiful
royal livery of the Grand Panjandrum, who
flitted about executing immediately the slightest
wish echoed in that wonderful place.</p>

<p>"But it is sufficient to say that, after a lot of
ceremony, I was at last ushered into the presence
of the Grand Panjandrum himself.</p>

<p>"It is forbidden to anyone, under the most
awful penalties, to describe His Supreme Importance's
appearance, so I cannot tell you what he
was like; but I found him suffering the most
excruciating agony with the toothache, and with
his face even more swollen than the Chief Cook's
had been.</p>

<p>"At a sign from the Court Physician I quickly
prepared my nettle leaves, which we had thought
to gather on our way to the palace, and began to
rub them gently on the Grand Panjandrum's
cheek, on the opposite side of his face to that
which was swollen.</p>

<p>"To my horror and amazement, they had no
effect whatever, except immediately to raise a
terrible rash upon His Supreme Importance's
cheek, and to cause him such pain that he called
out angrily that it was worse than the toothache
itself.</p>

<p>"I hurriedly and anxiously consulted my little
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 20]<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>book to see if by any mischance I had failed in
carrying out any of the directions; but no, there
it was in black and white&mdash;'rub the <i>other</i> side
with a stinging nettle.'</p>

<p>"I showed it to the Court Physician, and he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Try the "other" side, then: you've rubbed
one side, try the other.'</p>

<p>"So in fear and trembling I begged His
Supreme Importance's permission to apply the
remedy to his other cheek, and after some demur
he agreed, but making it a condition that if it
failed to act I was to be immediately beheaded.</p>

<p>"You may imagine with what anxiety I
awaited the result of my experiment, and how
carefully I rubbed the nettles on.</p>

<p>"It was all in vain: the rash spread under the
nettles and the swelling grew greater than ever&mdash;evidently
my fairy power refused to work&mdash;and
the Grand Panjandrum was in a fearful
rage.</p>

<p>"'Fetch the Executioner!' he cried, in terrible
tones. 'I will see this impostor executed before
my eyes!' And twenty slaves flew to obey his
command.</p>

<p>"'Grin!' whispered the Court Physician behind
his hand, 'grin and bear it; it's the only

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>"I gave him a wrathful glance, and was about
to speak, when at a sign from the Grand Panjandrum,
two powerful slaves sprang forward and
bound and gagged me.</p>

<p>"There was a sound of approaching footsteps,
and from another entrance the Executioner
appeared, followed by some slaves carrying the
block.</p>

<p>"I thought my last moment had arrived, but
just then, to my intense delight, I felt a curious
sensation, which told me that I was about to
disappear.</p>

<p>"My feet went first (this is not always the case),
and then my legs, and I could see the amazement
with which the Grand Panjandrum and all the
assembled company were regarding the, to them,
extraordinary phenomenon.</p>

<p>"The Executioner in his agitation dropped his
axe, and stood open-mouthed regarding what was
left of me; and, although I was rather anxious lest
they should make an attempt to chop off my
head before it finally disappeared, I managed
despite my gag to 'grin' in the Grand Panjandrum's
face, and an instant later I found myself
here."</p>

<p>Shin Shira, having finished his story, drew his
little fan from his sleeve and sat fanning himself
with great composure, while he regarded
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 22]<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>my doubtless astonished face with considerable
amusement.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'll put that story down at once, if you
don't mind," I stammered, hurrying to my desk
and getting out some papers.</p>

<p>The drawer stuck, and it was some seconds
before I could get it open, and when I turned
round again, to my great dismay, Shin Shira
had almost disappeared.</p>

<p>The little yellow shoes were still there and part
of a stocking, but even as I watched them they
too disappeared, the long pointed toes of the
shoes waggling a kind of farewell&mdash;or so I thought&mdash;and
my strange little visitor had vanished.</p>

<h3>SHIN SHIRA AND THE DRAGON</h3>


<p>It was during my holidays in Cornwall that I
next met Shin Shira.</p>

<p>I had ridden by motor-car from Helston to the
Lizard, and after scrambling over rugged cliffs
for some time, following the white stones put by
the coastguards to mark the way, I found myself
at last at the most beautiful little bay imaginable,
called Kynance Cove.</p>

<p>The tide was low, and from the glittering white
sands, tall jagged rocks rose up, covered with
coloured seaweed; which, together with the deep
blue and green of the sky and sea, made a perfect
feast of colour for the eyes.</p>

<p>On the shore I met an amiable young guide,
who, for sixpence, undertook to show me some
caves in the rocks which are not generally
discovered by visitors.</p>

<p>They were very fine caves, one of them being
called The Princess's Parlour; and while we were
exploring this, I suddenly heard a roar as of some
mighty animal in terrible pain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 24]<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>I turned to the guide with, I expect, rather a
white face, for an explanation.</p>

<p>He smiled at my alarm, however, and told me
that it was "only the Bellows," and suggested a
visit to the spot whence the sound proceeded.</p>

<p>We scrambled out of the cave and descended
to the sands again, and passing behind a tall rock
called The Tower, we saw a curious sight.</p>

<p>From between two enormous boulders came
at intervals a great cloud of fine spray, which
puffed up into the air for about twenty feet,
accompanied by the roaring noise that I had
previously noticed. My young guide explained
to me that the noise and the spray were caused
by the air in the hollow between the two boulders
being forcibly expelled through a narrow slit in
the rocks as each wave of the incoming tide
entered. Having made this quite clear to me, he
took his departure, warning me not to remain too
long on the sands, as the tide was coming in
rather rapidly.</p>

<p>I sat for some time alone on the rocks, gazing
with fascinated interest at the curious effect
produced by the clouds of spray coming from
"the Bellows," and was at last just turning to
go when I started in surprise, for there, sitting
on another rock just behind me, was the little
Yellow Dwarf, Shin Shira, energetically fanning
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>himself with the little yellow fan which I had
noticed at our previous meeting.</p>

alt="Illustration: Sitting on another rock just behind me, was the little Yellow Dwarf"
title="sitting on another rock just behind me, was the little Yellow Dwarf" /></div>

<p>"Oh! it's you, is it?" he remarked, when he
caught sight of my face. "I thought I recognised
the back view; you see it was the last I saw of you
when I paid you
that visit in your
study."</p>

<p>"And disappeared
so very
suddenly," I answered,
going up
and offering my
hand, for I was
very pleased to
see the little man
again.</p>

<p>"I was <i>obliged</i>
to. You know of
my unfortunate
affliction in having
to appear or
disappear whenever my fairy great-great-great-grandmother
wishes. <i>He's</i> safe enough, isn't
he?" he added, inconsequently nodding his head
towards "the Bellows."</p>

<p>"Who is? What do you mean?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"The dragon, of course," said Shin Shira.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 26]<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>"The dragon!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;you know that there's a dragon
imprisoned behind those rocks, don't you?"</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "although I must admit that I
was at first inclined to think that something of
the sort was concealed there. I've had it all
explained to me, though," and I proceeded to
inform him of what the guide had told me
concerning the matter.</p>

<p>"Pooh! Rubbish! He doesn't know what
he's talking about," said Shin Shira contemptuously;
"I'll tell you the real story of those rocks
as it occurred, let's see&mdash;about eight or nine
hundred years ago. I remember it quite well,
for it was one of those occasions when I was <i>most</i>
distressed at having to disappear at what was
for me the very worst possible moment."</p>

<p>I settled myself comfortably on the rocks
beside Shin Shira and prepared to listen with great
interest.</p>

<p>"Let's think for a moment," said the little
Yellow Dwarf, looking about him.</p>

<p>"It began&mdash;oh, yes! I know now. In that
cave over yonder&mdash;I was eight or nine hundred
years younger then, and a very warm-blooded
and impressionable young fellow at that time;
and I can remember being struck with the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 27]<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span> extreme beauty of the charming Princess whom
I discovered in tears there when I suddenly
appeared.</p>

<p>"The cave itself was hung about with the most
beautiful silken curtains and tapestries, and on
the floor were spread rugs and carpets and cushions
of Oriental magnificence. Tiny tables, inlaid
with ivory and mother-of-pearl, were scattered
about, on which were caskets filled with beautiful
jewels and rare curios from foreign lands.</p>

<p>"The Princess herself was reclining on one of
the cushions, sobbing as though her heart would
break, and her beautiful hair was lying in dishevelled
glory about her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I was afraid of alarming her, so I coughed
slightly to attract her attention.</p>

<p>"She started up immediately with a look of
terror, but was calmed in an instant when she
saw who it was.</p>

<p>"'Oh!' she cried, 'have you slain him?
You must have done in order to have reached
here. Oh! have you come to save me?' and
she looked at me with wild, eager eyes.</p>

<p>"'Calm yourself, fair lady!' said I. 'What
is it that alarms you? Be sure that I will do
all in my power to protect you from any evil that
threatens you.'</p>

<p>"'The Dragon!' gasped the Princess. 'Have
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 28]<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>you not slain him? How else can you have
entered? He lies at the door of the cave.'</p>

<p>"She caught me by the hand and led me to
the entrance, and then, clasping one hand over
her eyes and shuddering with terror, she pointed
to where, a short distance beyond, under the
shadow of some rocks, lay a terrible Dragon,
watching with cruel and expectant eyes for any
prey that might come his way.</p>

<p>"'I cannot get away from here except I pass
him, and I have been imprisoned here now for
two days,' sobbed the Princess. 'The King, my
father, must indeed be distraught at my absence,'
and she burst into fresh weeping.</p>

<p>"I pressed her to tell me how she came there,
and she explained to me that one day, while
walking on the sands with one of her maidens in
attendance, they had together discovered this
cave, which was only accessible at low tide;
and they had secretly brought the rugs and
tapestries and other furniture with which the
cave was filled and made a bower of it, to which
the Princess was wont to retire whenever she
wished to be alone.</p>

<p>"And, venturing here two days since without
attendance, the Princess had found, when she
had wished to depart, the terrible monster lying
in her path.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 29]<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>"'And so,' she cried, 'I have been a prisoner
all this time.'</p>

<p>"I cheered her as well as I was able, and turned
to my little book to see if by chance it gave me
any directions how I might slay a Dragon by
means of my fairy powers; and I read there that
though one might not slay it (for a Dragon lives
for a thousand years), one might rob it of its
power by casting at it a jewel of great brilliancy,
at the same time wishing that he might become
dazed and impotent till one could escape, and it
would be so.</p>

<p>"I told this to the Princess, and she hastened
to unfasten from her bosom a jewel of great value
set in gold of curious workmanship, which she
gave to me, imploring me at the same time to do
immediately as the book directed.</p>

<p>"'Nay,' said I, 'the jewel is yours; you must
cast it at the Dragon, and I will <i>wish</i> that the
fairies may aid us.'</p>

<p>"And so we stood at the door of the cave, and
the Dragon, seeing us, came forward with wide-opened
jaws.</p>

<p>"The Princess clung to my arm with one hand,
but with the other she cast the jewel, while with
all my desire I wished that my fairy powers might
not fail me now.</p>

<p>"Whether, however, it was that the fairies
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 30]<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>willed it so, or perchance because she was a girl,
the Princess's aim was not straight, and she hit,
not the Dragon, but a great boulder in the
shadow of which he was lurking; and then a
truly remarkable thing occurred, for the boulder,
immediately it was struck by the jewel, tumbled
forward, and falling upon one beside it, imprisoned
the Dragon between the two, where he has
remained to this day."</p>

<p>And Shin Shira pointed dramatically to the
rocks, from which an extra large puff of spray
belched forth, with a groan and a cry which
almost convinced me that what he told me must
be true.</p>

<p>"And what became of the Princess after
that?" I inquired, being anxious to hear the end
of the story.</p>

<p>"Why," resumed Shin Shira, "we picked up
the jewel and hurried away from the spot, and
presently came at the top of the cliffs to the
Castle, the ruins of which may still be seen up
yonder&mdash;to where the King dwelt.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you with what joy the Princess
was received, nor with what honour and favour
I was rewarded by the King&mdash;and, indeed, by all
of the people&mdash;as the Princess's deliverer.</p>

<p>"It is enough to say that the King called a
great assembly of people, and before them all
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 31]<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>said that as a fitting reward he should give me
the fairest jewel in all his kingdom, and handed
me the very stone which had been cast at the
Dragon, and which was valuable beyond price,
being one of the most perfect and flawless stones
in the world.</p>

<p>"I was glad enough to have the gem, but I
had fallen madly in love with the Princess's
beauty, so I made bold to remind the King
that the fairest jewel in his kingdom was not
the gem he had given me, but the Princess, his
daughter.</p>

<p>"The answer pleased the King and the people,
though I remember sometimes sadly, even now,
that the Princess's face fell as she heard the King
declare that his word should be kept, and the
fairest jewel of all, even the Princess herself,
should be mine.</p>

<p>"But now, alas! comes the sorrowful part,
for, before the ceremony of our marriage could
be completed, I was doomed by the fairies to
disappear, and so I lost for ever my beautiful
bride," and Shin Shira gave a deep sigh. "The
jewel though," he added, "remained mine, and
I have always worn it in the front of my turban
in honour and memory of the lovely Princess.
You may like to see it," and Shin Shira reached
up to his head for the turban in which I had
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 32]<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>noticed the jewel sparkling only a moment
before.</p>

<p>It was gone!</p>

<p>"Dear me! I'm disappearing again myself,
I'm afraid," said Shin Shira, looking down at
his legs, from which the feet had already vanished.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" he had just time to call out,
before he departed in a little yellow flicker.</p>

<p>"Hi! Hi!" I heard voices shouting, and
looking up to the cliffs I saw some people waving
frantically. "Come up quickly, or you'll be
cut off," they shouted.</p>

<p>And I hurried along the sands, only just in
time, for I had been so interested in Shin Shira's
story that I had not noticed how the tide had
been creeping up. I shall have a good look at
that jewel in Shin Shira's turban next time I see
him&mdash;and as for "the Bellows," I hardly know
which explanation to accept, Shin Shira's or that
of the guide.</p>

<h2><a name="MYSTERY_NO_III" id="MYSTERY_NO_III"></a>MYSTERY NO. III</h2>

<h3>THE MAGIC CARPET</h3>


<p>It was just at the end of the school term, and
I had received a letter from my young cousin
Lionel, who was at Marlborough, reminding me
of my promise that he should spend a part at
least of his holidays with me.</p>

<p>"Mind you're at the station in time," he
had said; "and, I say! please don't call me
Lionel if there are any of our fellows about, it
sounds so kiddish. Just call me Sutcliffe, and
I'll call you sir&mdash;as you're so old&mdash;like we do
the masters. Oh yes! and there's something I
want you to buy for me, very particularly&mdash;it's
for my study. I've got a study this term, and
I share it with a fellow named Gammage. He's
an awfully good egg!"</p>

<p>"What extraordinary language schoolboys do
manage to get hold of," I thought as I re-read
the letter while bowling along in the cab on my
way to the station, which, a very few minutes
later, came in sight, the platform being crowded
with parents, relatives and friends waiting to
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 34]<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>meet the train by which so many Marlburians
were travelling.</p>

<p>There was a shriek from an engine, and a rattle
and clatter outside the station, as the train,
every window filled with boys' excited faces,
came dashing up to the platform.</p>

<p>"There's my people!" "There's Tom!"
"Hi! hi! Here I am!" "There's the pater
with the trap!" "Hooray!" To the accompaniment
of a babel of cries like these, and
amidst an excited scramble of half-wild school-boys,
I at last discovered my small cousin.</p>

<p>"There he is!" he said, pointing me out to a
young friend who was with him; and coming up
he hurriedly offered his hand.</p>

<p>"How are you, <i>Sutcliffe</i>?" I asked, remembering
his letter.</p>

<p>"All right, thanks," he replied. "This is
Gammage. I wanted to show you to him. He
wouldn't believe I had a cousin as old as you are.
See, Gammage?"</p>

<p>Gammage looked at me and nodded. "'Bye,
Sutcliffe; good-bye, sir," said he, raising his hat
to me and hurrying off to his "people."</p>

<p>"I say! don't forget the rug, Sutcliffe!" he
bawled over his shoulder before finally disappearing.</p>

<p>"Oh no! I say, sir! <i>That's</i> what I want
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 35]<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>to ask you about," said Sutcliffe, scrambling into
the taxi, and settling himself down with a little
nod of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"What?" I inquired, as we bowled out of
the station.</p>

<p>"Why, a rug for my&mdash;our&mdash;study," said the
boy. "Gammage has bought no end of things
to make our room comfortable, and they've sent
me up some pictures and chairs and things from
home&mdash;and&mdash;it would be awfully decent of you
if you'd buy me a rug to put in front of the fire-place.
It's rather cheek to ask, but you generally
give me something when I come over to see you,
and I arranged with Gammage to say I'd rather
have that than anything. What sort of a shop
do you get rugs at? Couldn't we get it on our
way now, and then it would be done with? I
might forget to ask you about it later on."</p>

<p>"What sort of a rug do you want?" I asked,
as the taxi turned into Tottenham Court Road.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, sir. Any sort of an
ordinary kind of rug will do. There's some in
that window; one of those would do."</p>

<p>I stopped the taxi and we got out. The window
was filled with Oriental rugs and carpets, and a
card in their midst stated that they were "a
recent consignment of genuine old goods direct
from Arabia."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 36]<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>"Oh, they're too expensive, I expect," I
remarked, as we stood amongst a small crowd of
people in front of the window, "those Oriental
rugs are generally so&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Sutcliffe suddenly nudged my arm, and,
with an amused twinkle in his eye, called my
attention to a remarkable little figure standing
beside him, dressed in an extraordinary yellow
costume, and wearing a turban.</p>

<p>"Why! bless me! It's Shin Shira!" I
exclaimed. "I hadn't noticed you before."</p>

<p>"No," said the Yellow Dwarf, "I've only just
appeared. How very strange meeting you here!"</p>

<p>I told him what we were doing, and introduced
my young cousin, who was greatly interested
and somewhat awe-struck at the extraordinary
little personage in the Oriental costume, whose
remarkable appearance was causing quite a
sensation amongst the bystanders.</p>

<p>"Oh, these rugs," he said, looking at them
casually. "No, I don't fancy they are much
good for your purpose, they seem to be too&mdash;hullo!"
he suddenly cried excitedly, "what's
that? Good gracious! I really believe it's&mdash;Why,
yes! I'm sure of it! I recognise it quite
well by the pattern. There's not another in the
world like it. How could it possibly have got
here?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 37]<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span>"What <i>are</i> you talking about?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, this carpet," cried Shin Shira, pointing
excitedly to a very quaint-looking Oriental rug
in the corner of the window. "It's the Magic
Carpet which everybody has read about in the
<i>Arabian Nights</i>. It enables anybody in whose
possession it is to travel anywhere they wish&mdash;surely
you must have heard about it."</p>

<p>"No!" cried Lionel, his eyes sparkling with
eagerness, "not really? Oh, sir! Do&mdash;<i>do</i>
please buy it&mdash;it will be simply ripping! Do!
do! Why, it will be better than an aeroplane."</p>

<p>I had never in my life before seen my cousin
so excited about anything.</p>

<p>"I should certainly advise you to purchase it,"
whispered Shin Shira. "It is a very valuable
rug, and no doubt you would find it very useful
in many ways."</p>

<p>I must confess to a considerable amount of
curiosity myself as we entered the shop and
asked to be shown the carpet which Shin Shira
declared to be endued with such remarkable
properties.</p>

<p>It was a very handsome one, and the shopkeeper
showed it to us with a considerable amount
of pride.</p>

<p>"It's a genuine article, sir," he told me.
"Came over only last week from Arabia in a
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 38]<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span>special parcel purchased by our agent in Baghdad&mdash;I
believe it's very old. These foreigners know
how to make things which will last."</p>

<p>I inquired the price, and hesitated considerably
when I found that it was far in excess of the
amount I had intended to pay for a rug.</p>

<p>However, Lionel seemed so very eager, and
Shin Shira assured me so positively that it was
really a bargain, that, with a sigh at what I feared
was a great piece of extravagance on my part, I
took out my purse and paid for it. "To where
shall I send it?" inquired the shopkeeper.</p>

<p>"Let's ride home on it and save the cab fare,"
whispered Shin Shira, pulling me down to his
level by my sleeve.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why not? It will be the quickest way
home, and certainly the least expensive," persuaded
the little Yellow Dwarf.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" I protested.</p>

<p>Shin Shira had already spread the carpet on
the ground, and pulling Lionel on to it, beckoned
me to follow.</p>

<p>Half mechanically I obeyed his instructions,
and had no sooner sat down on it, cross-legged,
as I saw that Shin Shira and Lionel were doing,
than the little Yellow Dwarf cried out something
in a language which I supposed to be</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Page_38a" id="Page_38a"></a><img src="./images/illus-038a.jpg" width="600" height="834"
alt="Illustration: We floated away over the roofs of the houses."
title="We floated away over the roofs of the houses" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 39]<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
Arabic&mdash;and immediately we began to rise into
the air.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the expression of dismay
on the countenance of the shopkeeper and his
assistants, when they saw us slowly floating in
the air towards the door.</p>

<p>"Open it! open it, somebody!" shouted
Shin Shira, and a bewildered-looking customer
who had just entered instinctively pulled the
handle. Before we knew where we were, we
found ourselves out in the open air with a shouting,
gesticulating, excited crowd watching us as
we rose higher and higher, and floated away
over the roofs of the houses.</p>

<p>The sensation, I must admit, was a pleasant
one, and, despite a slight feeling of nervousness
(which, however, young Sutcliffe did not appear
to share), I quite enjoyed the journey to my flat.</p>

<p>There were, fortunately, but very few people
about, and we arrived at the door without attracting
much attention.</p>

<p>One nervous old lady, at whose feet we
descended somewhat suddenly, did threaten to
call the police&mdash;saying rather angrily that "What
with motor-cars and such-like," she "didn't
know what we were a-coming to, and it wasn't
safe for a respectable lady to walk about the
streets, what with one thing and another."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 40]<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>I managed, however, to soothe her ruffled
feelings, and, rolling the rug up carefully, we went
up to the flat. I threw myself into a chair
in the study, thoroughly tired out and not a little
bewildered by the strange events of the morning.</p>

<p>Lionel, however, was full of excitement, and
eager to be off again for a ride on the marvellous
Magic Carpet.</p>

<p>"I say! you know! but it's the rippingest
thing I've ever heard of. Why, we'll be able
to go anywhere. Just think what an awful lot
we'll save in railway fares and cabs and those
sort of things. I suppose anybody can use it?"
he inquired, turning to Shin Shira.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course," declared the little
Yellow Dwarf, "so long as you say, out loud,
where you want to go to."</p>

<p>"Oh! Do let's go out again&mdash;just for a little
while," pleaded Lionel. "Can't we go to
Gammage's? He lives over at Wimbledon. It's
quite easy to get to, and it won't take long. We
could be back to lunch, and I should <i>so</i> like him
to see the Magic Carpet. Do come, sir."</p>

<p>"No," I replied, shaking my head, "I'm too
tired. You two can go if you like, only be back
in an hour and a half."</p>

<p>"Oh, jolly!" cried Lionel. "Come on, please&mdash;let's
start at once."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 40]<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>And he picked up the carpet under his arm.</p>

<p>"I think it would attract less attention if,
instead of starting from the pavement, we went
out of the window," said Shin Shira. "What
do you say?"</p>

<p>"By all means," I replied, "if you think best,"
for you see, having ridden on it myself, I felt perfectly
safe in trusting my young cousin on the
Magic Carpet, and I felt sure that Shin Shira
would not let him come to any harm.</p>

<p>So we opened the window, and a minute later
the two were gaily floating away out of sight,
both energetically waving their pocket-handkerchiefs
until they disappeared.</p>

<p>I could tell by the noise in the street that
their strange method of conveyance was attracting
considerable attention; but as I felt thankful
to note, no one seemed to connect their
appearance with my rooms.</p>

<p>The next hour or so passed quickly enough,
and I did not begin to get in the least anxious
till I heard the clock strike two, and then I
suddenly realised that they were over half-an-hour
late.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're all right," I consoled myself
with thinking. "I expect Gammage is so interested
in the wonderful carpet that they can't
get away."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 42]<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>When three hours had passed, however, and
there was no sign of their return, I began to get
seriously alarmed.</p>

<p>"What can have happened?" I thought, and,
to add to my discomfiture, a telegram arrived
from Lionel's parents inquiring if he had arrived
in London safely from Marlborough.</p>

<p>I was able to reply, truthfully, that he <i>had</i>
arrived safely, but, as hour after hour passed by
without any trace of either Shin Shira or the boy,
I became more and more disturbed.</p>

<p>At last I could stand it no longer, but putting
on my hat, I hurried off to the nearest Police
Station.</p>

<p>"H'm! What do you say, sir?" said the
Police Inspector whom I found there, seated
before a large open book, when in a broken
voice I had hurriedly explained that I feared
that my young cousin was lost. "Went off in
company with a foreign-looking gent&mdash;Just
describe him to me, please, as near as you can."</p>

<p>I described Shin Shira's appearance as accurately
as I could, and the Police Inspector looked
up hurriedly and gave me a searching glance.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say the gent was going
about the streets dressed like <i>that</i>?" he asked,
when I had told him about Shin Shira's yellow
costume and turban.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 43]<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>"Yes," I replied in some confusion, "he is a
foreigner, you know, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where does he come from?"</p>

<p>"From Japan, I think, or China, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Shin Shira Scaramanga Manousa Yama
Hama is his full name, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Police Inspector laid down his pen and
stared again at me.</p>

<p>"It's a curious name," said he; "I'll get you
to write it down for me. I don't think I should
be surprised at <i>anything</i> happening to <i>anyone</i>
with a name like that. Where do you say they
were going?"</p>

<p>"Well," I explained, "they set out to go to
Wimbledon to see a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wimbledon? Let's see, from Kensington
they'd go by train I suppose, from High Street
Station, and change at&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," I interrupted, "they didn't go by
train at all, they&mdash;" and here I paused, for I
suddenly reflected how exceedingly unlikely the
Inspector would be to believe me if I told him
exactly <i>how</i> they set out for Wimbledon. "You
see," I began by way of explanation, "I bought
a rug this morning that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," said the Inspector somewhat
impatiently, "would you mind keeping
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 44]<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>to the subject. How did Mr. Shin&mdash;er&mdash;the
foreigner I mean, and your cousin go to Wimbledon?
If they didn't go by train, did they drive
or go by motor, or what?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was trying to tell you. You see, I
bought a rug this morning, that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I <i>don't</i> want to hear about your rug, sir,"
said the Inspector quite angrily. "If you wish
us to try and find the young gentleman you must
answer my questions properly. How did he set
out to go to Wimbledon? Come, come! Let's
begin at the beginning. Which way did they
turn when they left your door?"</p>

<p>"You see, they didn't exactly leave by the
door," I began.</p>

<p>"How did they go then, out of the window?"
asked the Inspector in a somewhat sarcastic
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "that's just how they did
go."</p>

<p>The Inspector looked bewildered.</p>

<p>"Look here, sir," he said at last, "you told
me when you gave me your name and address
that you lived in a flat at Kensington on the
second floor, and now you tell me that your
cousin and a foreign gentleman with an outlandish
name and dressed like a Guy Fawkes,
left your house by the window. Really!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 45]<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>"So they <i>did</i>," I explained; "you see, I
bought a rug this morning that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Bother</i> the rug, sir!" shouted the Inspector,
angrily throwing down his pen.</p>

<p>"If you <i>won't</i> listen to what I have to say,"
I said with some amount of dignity, "how can
I possibly tell you what I know? I am <i>endeavouring</i>
to explain that my cousin and the gentleman
left in a very remarkable manner by means of a
Magic Carpet, which&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," said the Inspector, getting
up from his seat and showing me the door, "it
strikes me that it's a lunatic asylum you want
and not a Police Station. I haven't any time to
waste with people who come here with stories
like that. Good-evening!" And he shut the
door, leaving me outside on the step.</p>

<p>I went to several other stations, and finally to
Scotland Yard, but I could get no one to believe
my extraordinary story; and at last I went to
bed quite bewildered and in a terribly anxious
frame of mind, leaving the lights burning and the
windows wide open in case the wanderers returned
during the night.</p>

<p>The next day, not hearing any news, I was
obliged to telegraph for Lionel's father and
mother; and I had a terrible scene with them,
for they reproached me over and over again for
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 46]<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>letting their son venture out upon the Magic
Carpet.</p>

<p>"You must have known," said my aunt
tearfully, "that it was dangerous to trust to
such heathenish and out-of-date methods of
travelling, and now the poor dear boy is probably
transformed or bewitched, or done something
terrible to by this wretched Yellow Dwarf
friend of yours, with the awful name. It's
really disgraceful of you to have let him go at
all!"</p>

<p>And so, amid the most bitter reproaches, although
I left no stone unturned in my hopeless
search for Lionel and Shin Shira, several days
flew by, till one morning I nearly leaped from
my chair in surprise and delight, at seeing the
following report in the paper&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Extraordinary Rescue at Sea</span></p>

<p>"By Marconigram comes a message from
mid-ocean that two days ago the S.S. <i>Ruby</i>, from
Liverpool to New York, picked up at sea, under
extraordinary circumstances, an English school-boy
who states that he was travelling by means
of a Magic Carpet, which he was unable to
manage. He was found to be in a state of
complete exhaustion, but has since recovered,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 47]<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>and appears to be a lively, intelligent lad. He
will be landed at New York."</p></div>

<p>It is needless to say that my uncle and myself
lost no time in putting ourselves in communication
with the steamship people, and of course
found that the rescued lad was no other than
Lionel.</p>

<p>His father and I crossed over by the next boat,
and found him happy and well and being made a
tremendous fuss of by everybody at the hotel
where we had arranged for him to stay till our
arrival.</p>

<p>"Of course," he explained in telling us all
about it, "everything went all right at first, and
we went to Gammage's house in no time, but he
was out. We landed in the garden, and nobody
saw us, and I went up to the front door and
knocked, and when I found Gammage wasn't
at home I just went back to Shin Shira and asked
where else we could go, because I didn't want to
go home so soon.</p>

<p>"'How would you like to go over to France?'
he said; 'we could do it in about twenty
minutes.'</p>

<p>"So of course I said yes, and we were crossing
the Channel all right when he suddenly began to
disappear.</p>

<p>"You can guess I was in an awful funk when
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 48]<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>I found myself alone on the beastly old carpet,
and I couldn't manage it at all. I suppose it
was because I couldn't speak the language; Shin
Shira used Arabic or something, wasn't it? I
tried all sorts of things too, a little bit of French&mdash;you
know, 'Avez-vous la plume de ma s&oelig;ur?'
and 'Donnez-moi du pain,' and things like that
out of my French exercises, but it didn't do any
good: we only went out to sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./images/illus-048.png" width="600" height="515"
alt="Illustration: I found myself alone on the beastly old carpet."
title="I found myself alone on the beastly old carpet." /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 49]<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>"It was frightfully cold all night, and I couldn't
sleep at all, and I began to get awfully hungry;
but the next morning about eleven o'clock I
began to descend very slowly and gradually
down to the sea. I thought I was going to be
drowned, but fortunately just before I touched
the water they saw me from the <i>Ruby</i>, and
sent a boat out to pick me up. Everybody was
awfully decent on board, and I had plenty of
grub and changed my clothes. A fellow who
was going over with his people lent me his while
mine were being dried.</p>

<p>"Then when I got to New York your cable
message was there waiting for me, so I knew it
was all right."</p>

<p>We were very thankful to have found the boy
again, and within three weeks we were happily
home once more, and the adventure with the
Magic Carpet was a thing of the past.</p>

<p>The carpet itself was left floating out at sea,
and from that day to this I have not heard of it
again.</p>

<h2><a name="MYSTERY_NO_IV" id="MYSTERY_NO_IV"></a>MYSTERY NO. IV</h2>

<h3>SHIN SHIRA AND THE DUCHESS</h3>


<p>It all began with the collar-stud&mdash;at least I
put it down at that.</p>

<p>You see, I was dressing rather nervously to
go to a charity "At Home" at the Duchess of
Kingslake's. I had not met the lady previously,
but some young friends of mine had been invited
to the "At Home," and they had persuaded
the Duchess to ask me too.</p>

<p>I do not know many titled people, and had
never before visited a real live Duchess, so I was
just telling myself that I must really be on my
very best behaviour, and above all, that I must
not be late in arriving. The card had mentioned
"4 to 6.30," and it was past three o'clock
now.</p>

<p>I was just struggling to fix my collar, which
was rather stiff and tight, when suddenly the
stud popped out and rolled away to&mdash;where?</p>

<p>Down I got on my hands and knees, and groped
about in every direction that I could think of.
I lit a candle, and searched in every available
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 51]<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>hiding-place; but no&mdash;no collar-stud could be
anywhere found.</p>

<p>And the time was going on. I rang the bell
for Mrs. Putchy, my housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Please, Mrs. Putchy, send at once to the
nearest hosier's and buy me a plain collar-stud,
and kindly ask Mary to get back as quickly as
possible. I am expecting the cab every moment."</p>

<p>"It is at the door, sir," said Mrs. Putchy;
"and I don't know, I'm sure, where Mary will be
able to get a collar-stud for you to-day. This
is Thursday, you know, sir, early closing day."</p>

<p>Too true. It was indeed <i>most</i> unfortunate.
In my neighbourhood all the shops close at
two o'clock Thursdays, and it would have been
as easy to buy a collar-stud as an elephant at
Kensington just then.</p>

<p>What was to be done?</p>

<p>A sudden inspiration struck me.</p>

<p>I ran across to the study, and undoing my
desk, I found a little yellow-covered book attached
to a golden chain which I had picked up just
after my friend Shin Shira had vanished the
last time he had visited me.</p>

<p>It was the book which the fairies had given
him, and contained directions as to what to do
when in any difficulty. I hurriedly turned to
the letter C, intending to look for "collar-stud"&mdash;but,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 52]<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span> to my great disappointment, there was
no such word to be found.</p>

<p>"Of course not," I suddenly thought; "the
people who live in the land from which Shin
Shira comes don't wear such things," and I let
my mind wander back to my little friend with
his yellow silk costume and turban.</p>

<p>"Hullo! though," I exclaimed a moment
later, "what's this?"</p>

<p>My eyes had caught the words "<i>To obtain
your wishes</i>" at the top of one of the pages.</p>

<p>I hastily read what followed, and gathered
from what was written that <i>anybody</i> could have
at least <i>two</i> wishes granted by the fairies if he
only went about it in the right way and followed
the given directions closely. It appeared that
one must hop round three times, first on one
foot and then on the other, repeating the following
words aloud, and wishing very hard&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Fairies! fairies! grant my wishes,</span><br />
<span class="i2">You can do so if you will,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Birds and beasts and little fishes</span><br />
<span class="i2">One and all obey you still.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fairies! Please to show me how</span><br />
<span class="i2">You can grant my wishes <i>now</i>."</span><br />
</div>

<p>Of course <i>I</i> immediately wished for a collar-stud,
and I was just hopping round on my right
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 53]<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>leg for the third time, having begun with the
left one, when Mrs. Putchy entered the room.</p>

<p>She looked rather surprised at seeing me
engaged in what must have seemed to her rather
an extraordinary occupation, but she is so used
to strange things happening with me that she
made no remark, except to point to a spot just
in front of the fire-place, where, to my great
surprise, I could see the very collar-stud which
I had wanted.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary!" I exclaimed, as I picked
it up. "I could have declared that it was not
there a minute ago, for as you know, Mrs.
Putchy, I searched everywhere for it."</p>

<p>"The cabman, sir, is getting impatient," said
Mrs. Putchy, as she put down my coat and hat
which she had thoughtfully brought to my
room.</p>

<p>"Well, we won't keep him waiting long now,"
I smilingly said as I hurriedly completed my
dressing, and a very few minutes later, the cab
was quickly bowling me towards my destination.</p>

<p>The mansion near Grosvenor Square, at which
the Duchess resided, was a very grand one, and
red carpet was laid down the steps and across
the pavement for the convenience of the guests,
who were arriving in large numbers at the same
time as myself. Fortunately, just inside the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 54]<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>hall I met my little friends the Verrinder
children; Vera, the little girl, looking very
pretty in her white party frock; and her two
brothers, Dick and Fidge, full of excitement and
high spirits.</p>

<p>They fastened on me at once and dragged me
most unceremoniously up to our hostess, who
it appears was Vera's godmother, and introduced
me in their own fashion.</p>

<p>"This is the gentleman who tells stories,
godmamma," said Vera.</p>

<p>"And knows all about the Wallypug and the
Dodo and Shin Shira, and all sorts of things,"
declared Dick.</p>

<p>"And if you ask him&mdash;" began Fidge, when
the Duchess interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Really, children, you mustn't rattle on so.
I am very pleased to meet your friend, and I
trust that he will have an enjoyable afternoon,"
and the lady smiled graciously and held out the
tips of her fingers for me to shake.</p>

<p>I bowed as politely as I knew how, and,
following the children, was soon in the large
drawing-room, which was already half filled with
young people who had come to the "At Home."</p>

<p>It appeared that a very grand personage
indeed was to be present. A real live Princess
was coming to receive purses of money which
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 55]<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>the children had collected themselves, on behalf
of the poor and sick in the East-end of London;
and, after the purses had been given, there was
to be a kind of concert and entertainment.</p>

<p>Footmen were walking about with tea and
cakes of all sorts, and the time passed very
pleasantly, till presently there was a commotion
at the door, and Her Royal Highness the
Princess entered and was led to the end of the
room, where a tiny little girl presented a beautiful
bouquet of flowers.</p>

<p>The Princess made a gracious little speech,
saying how glad she was to come on behalf of
the poor people to receive the purses of money
which the children had collected; and then as
they passed up one by one and laid their purses
on the silver tray beside her, she had a smile
and a little happy nod for each of them.</p>

<p>It was a very pretty sight, but soon over, for
the Princess, who is devoted to good works, had
to hurry away to another work of charity in a
distant part of London.</p>

<p>We were all sorry when she went, but were
not allowed to get dull, for almost immediately
afterwards the concert began.</p>

<p>Several ladies and gentlemen sang, and a
wonderful boy-pianist played some music of his
own composing; a little girl played the violin
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 56]<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>delightfully; and a very humorous gentleman
was giving a musical sketch at the piano and
making us all laugh very much, when I suddenly
noticed that the Duchess, who was sitting by
herself on a settee, had raised her lorgnette and
was staring curiously, and rather apprehensively,
at something beside her.</p>

<p>It was yellow in colour and seemed to grow
larger every minute. I had imagined at first
that it was a cushion, but now it suddenly
occurred to me that it was Shin Shira appearing.</p>

<p>Of course! and a minute or two later there he
sat, cross-legged, composedly fanning himself on
the settee beside the Duchess.</p>

<p>I could see her draw her skirts aside and
regard the little Yellow Dwarf in a puzzled
and bewildered manner; and, as soon as
the musical sketch was concluded, she called
one of the footmen to her and told him to
"remove that extraordinary-looking person
immediately."</p>

<p>Vera and the boys, however, had caught sight
of Shin Shira, and flew forward to claim acquaintance
with him.</p>

<p>"It's Shin Shira, you know, godmamma.
He's a friend of the gentleman who came with
us&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 57]<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>"He was not invited," said the Duchess,
looking with great disfavour at the little Yellow
Dwarf, "and it was exceedingly impertinent of
your friend to bring him without an invitation&mdash;I
am displeased."</p>

<p>"Madam," said Shin Shira, getting down to
the floor and bowing low in the Oriental manner,
"you are mistaken in thinking that I came
with a friend. I&mdash;er&mdash;appeared, because I was
<i>obliged</i> to do so&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Duchess came over to where I was sitting.</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i> you know this person?" she inquired,
pointing with her glasses towards Shin Shira.
"Who and what is he? Did you bring him
here, and if so why?"</p>

<p>"I am acquainted with the gentleman, Duchess,"
I admitted, "but he did not come with me.
I can tell you, however, that now he is here he
can be made very useful in entertaining your
guests&mdash;he is a conjurer of very remarkable
powers, and I've no doubt whatever but that he
would be only too happy to exercise them for
the amusement of the company."</p>

<p>"That is a different matter," said the Duchess,
evidently somewhat mollified. "You may introduce
me."</p>

<p>I went to fetch Shin Shira, and had soon
performed the necessary ceremony.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 58]<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>"The Duchess would be very much obliged
if you would perform some conjuring tricks, as
I know you will do with pleasure," I whispered.</p>

<p>"Delighted, I'm sure," replied the little
Yellow Dwarf; "that is one thing which I
flatter myself I can do very well, owing to my
fairy powers," and so it was arranged that he
was to begin immediately.</p>

<p>I cannot possibly tell you of all the wonderful
things he showed us. He made flowers grow
straight up from the carpet, and turned a gentleman's
walking-stick into a kind of Christmas-tree,
upon which hung a little present for every child
in the room: a fan for each of the ladies, and
a suitable gift for each of the gentlemen.</p>

<p>This was a most popular trick, it is needless
to say, and the numerous ladies and gentlemen
who had by this time joined the party were as
delighted as were the children themselves.</p>

<p>Shin Shira had become quite a centre of attraction,
and the Duchess smiled at me approvingly.</p>

<p>"Your friend is a great acquisition," she
remarked, coming over to the settee on which
I was seated. "Look! look! whatever is he
going to do now?"</p>

<p>I was as interested and puzzled as herself, for,
knowing of the extraordinary powers which my</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Page_58a" id="Page_58a"></a><img src="./images/illus-058a.jpg" width="600" height="833"
alt="Illustration: Shin Shira placed them in the Crystal Bowl."
title="Shin Shira placed them in the Crystal Bowl." /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 59]<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>little friend possessed, I could never be sure what
to expect from him in the way of the marvellous.</p>

<p>This time it was really a most interesting
trick.</p>

<p>First of all he turned an inkstand into a large
clear crystal bowl, and placed it on a little table
which stood in front of him. Then he asked
for anything to be given to him which the owner
wished to disappear.</p>

<p>Several gentlemen gave their watches, and
one or two ladies laughingly took off their
bracelets and handed them to Shin Shira, who
immediately placed them in the crystal bowl.</p>

<p>To our utter astonishment, each article as it
was placed into the bowl vanished from sight,
and Shin Shira turned the bowl upside down to
show that nothing was inside.</p>

<p>"It's really most marvellous," murmured the
Duchess, taking off a most valuable diamond
ornament and handing it to the Yellow Dwarf.
"Please make this disappear too. I shall value
it more highly than ever if I know that it has been
through such a wonderful adventure."</p>

<p>Shin Shira bowed, and taking the jewelled
ornament from the lady, he dropped it into the
bowl, where it at once shared the same fate as
the other articles.</p>

<p>"Ha! Hum!" said a grave and somewhat
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 60]<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>pompous voice, "our friend here might readily
become a very dangerous person if he exercised
his remarkable gifts in private, and made things
disappear in this extraordinary fashion, and then
refused to produce them again. Eh? Ha!
Hum!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;ha! ha! very good. Ha! ha!" laughed
a number of people who were standing near to
the guest who had spoken.</p>

<p>"That's the Lord Chief Justice," explained
a gentleman who stood near me. "That's why
everybody is laughing; it's considered very improper
not to laugh when the Lord Chief Justice
makes a joke&mdash;however feeble it is."</p>

<p>I hardly listened to what he was saying,
though, for I had suddenly noticed something
which caused me a good deal of anxiety.</p>

<p>Shin Shira was beginning to look very thin
and vapoury about the head, and, while I was
watching him, to my horror, he began to vanish
piecemeal till he had entirely disappeared from
sight, after giving me a strange, apologetic look.</p>

<p>The people clapped and stamped and laughed,
evidently imagining that it was all part of the
trick&mdash;but I&mdash;<i>I</i> knew differently, and scarcely
dared realise what it all meant for me.</p>

<p>For a few minutes everybody waited patiently
for him to appear again, and clapped and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 61]<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>stamped in great good humour. Presently, however,
they began to get rather tired and impatient,
and, after we had waited for about twenty
minutes, the delay began to get very awkward.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he come back?" inquired the
Duchess, in an impatient voice, coming over to
where I was standing. "The delay is becoming
very embarrassing."</p>

<p>I turned very red, I am afraid, for I hardly
liked to explain that the probability was that
he would <i>not</i> come back at all.</p>

<p>"Several of my guests are wanting to go early,
and they must have their jewellery before they
depart," she continued. "Can you not tell him
to hurry up?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;afraid n&mdash;not," I stammered.</p>

<p>"But you <i>must</i>," insisted the lady. "He's
your friend, and you brought him here, and I
shall look to you to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Duchess! I'm sorry to interrupt your
charming party, but will you please ask the
clever little gentleman who made my diamond
and ruby bracelet disappear if he would kindly
return it, as I really must be going," said a
lady, hurrying up. "And my emerald chain,
dear Duchess." "And my gold and pearl locket,"
chimed in several other voices.</p>

<p>"Yes, you simply must fetch him back
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 62]<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>somehow," said the Duchess, clutching my arm
nervously. "You see my guests are beginning
to get alarmed. You must!&mdash;you must!"</p>

<p>"B-but I can't&mdash;it's impossible," I endeavoured
to explain.</p>

<p>The Duchess grew pale. "Do you mean to
say," she gasped, "that the man has <i>really</i>
disappeared&mdash;and&mdash;and taken the things with
him? It's too terrible&mdash;too dreadful! What
<i>am</i> I to do? And all my guests! What will
they think of me? Oh! <i>Do&mdash;do</i>&mdash;do something!
I don't mind so much about my beautiful
diamond pendant, but do somehow get back the
things belonging to my guests. You brought
him here. You <i>must</i>!"</p>

<p>The grown-up guests were whispering together
in little anxious and indignant groups, and things
were beginning to look very serious&mdash;so serious
that I sank into a chair and buried my head in
my hands, trying to think of some possible way
out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>The Duchess was almost in tears, and several
ladies were trying to console her, when suddenly
I thought of a means of escape. Of course! the
wish! I had another wish left according to
what the little book had told me. I had <i>wished</i>
for a collar-stud, and had found my own.
<i>Perhaps</i> if I wished for the jewellery&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 63]<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>The thought no sooner entered my head than
I jumped up and began hopping on one leg
repeating&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Fairies, fairies! grant my wishes,</span><br />
<span class="i2">You can do so if you will,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Birds and beasts and&mdash;&mdash;"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Oh, he's mad, he's gone mad. Hold him,
somebody!" cried the Duchess when she saw me
hopping about in what must have appeared to
her a <i>most</i> eccentric manner; but, though several
gentlemen came up and caught hold of me, I
managed to get round three times on one leg, and
three times on the other, repeating the magic
rhyme, and then I wished&mdash;<i>wished</i> as hard as
ever I could&mdash;for the jewellery to be found,
before I sank down exhausted with my struggle.</p>

<p>Then a most remarkable thing happened, for
the gentleman who had been pointed out to me
as the Lord Chief Justice, and who had apparently
been more indignant than anyone else at the
disappearance of the jewellery, suddenly began
behaving in a very strange manner too, diving
his hands first into one pocket and then into
another and muttering&mdash;"Strange! remarkable!
Most extraordinary!" and finally drawing out
from every part of his clothing watches, chains,
rings, bracelets and jewellery of all kinds, till
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 64]<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span><i>every</i> missing article, including the Duchess's
diamond pendant, was restored to its proper
owner.</p>

<p>There was a pause at first, and then everybody
began to talk at once&mdash;laughing and protesting
that "of course they all <i>knew</i> it was part of the
trick, and they weren't <i>really</i> anxious at all,"
and so on, and I knew that the situation was
saved.</p>

<p>Even the Duchess beamed and admitted that
it was "really <i>quite</i> the most marvellous performance
she had ever seen," and thanked me over
and over again for having introduced such a
remarkable conjurer to her party. The guests
were all equally delighted, and amidst the
laughter and chatter that followed, the Verrinder
children and myself made good our escape, and
I felt very thankful that the fairies' "wish"
had got me out of what at one time bid fair to
have been a very awkward predicament.</p>

<div class="break">
* * * * * *
</div>

<p>The Duchess called on me the next day to
thank me again, and to ask where she might
write to my little friend to thank him also.
This information, however, I was naturally
unable to impart.</p>

<h2><a name="MYSTERY_NO_V" id="MYSTERY_NO_V"></a>MYSTERY NO. V</h2>

<h3>SHIN SHIRA AND THE LAME DUCK</h3>


<p>It was during the summer holidays and my
young cousin Lionel was staying with me again.
We had been spending the hot afternoon strolling
about Kensington Gardens, and had just been
enjoying a cup of tea and some cakes under the
trees at the little refreshment place near the
Albert Memorial.</p>

<p>"I think we'd better be going home now," I
said. "We'll get a motor-'bus at the gate."</p>

<p>"Oh! must we go yet?" pleaded Lionel.
"It's so jolly out here under the trees. Let's
walk home past the Round Pond."</p>

<p>"I've some letters to write before dinner," said
I, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, bother the old letters!" interrupted
Lionel. "It won't take much longer to walk,
and you'll get them done all right. Come
on!"</p>

<p>With a sigh of resignation, I not altogether
unwillingly let the young scamp have his way.</p>

<p>It was the best part of the day: the lengthening
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 66]<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>shadows and the cool breeze which had sprung
up made walking very enjoyable.</p>

<p>We had nearly reached the Round Pond when
I heard a startled "squ-a-a-k!" at my feet, and
a lame duck struggled up from the grass and
limped painfully off.</p>

<p>"Poor thing!" cried Lionel, who was a kind-hearted
little chap. "You nearly trod on it.
I wonder how it got to be lame."</p>

<p>"Some boys," said an indistinct voice close at
hand, "some boys threw a stone at it this afternoon
and injured its leg."</p>

<p>We looked round in great surprise, for there
seemed to be nobody about to account for the
voice; but presently I could just discern Shin
Shira's face and yellow turban appearing.</p>

<p>"Can't shake hands yet," said he, nodding
amiably, "for they haven't arrived at present,
but I've no doubt they'll be here shortly."</p>

<p>"I wonder how he'd get on if he wanted to
scratch his nose," whispered Lionel, who had a
keen sense of the ridiculous.</p>

<p>"It's rude to whisper in company," said Shin
Shira severely, evidently aware that some
remark had been made about himself&mdash;"but
there, you're only a boy, and boys are&mdash;Hullo!
here come my legs! that's all right! I thought
I shouldn't have to wait long for them. Where
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 67]<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>are you off to?" and the little Yellow Dwarf
hurried up to us now that he was quite complete.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're just walking home," I replied,
"only Lionel had a fancy to pass the Round
Pond on our way; the little model yachts one
often sees there are very amusing to watch."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Shin Shira. "There's one
been left behind to-day," he continued. "The
boys who threw the stone at the duck were seen
by the park keeper, and when he came after them
they ran away, leaving their boat behind them.
Serve them right if they lose it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! There it is now!" cried Lionel,
running towards the edge of the Round Pond.
"What a jolly little yacht. Why, it's a perfect
model," and he regarded it with the greatest
admiration. He took it from the water and
inspected it carefully.</p>

<p>"I say!" he cried excitedly, "wouldn't it be
ripping if we could become small enough to go
for a sail in it!"</p>

<p>"It's a very simple matter to arrange, if you
wish it," remarked Shin Shira composedly.</p>

<p>"D-do you really m-mean that it would be
possible for you to make us as tiny as that?"
stammered Lionel in his eagerness, his eyes
bright with excitement.</p>

<p>"I couldn't do it, but the fairies might,"
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 68]<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>said the Dwarf, taking up the little yellow book
which I had restored to him after our last
adventure.</p>

<p>"But should we be able to return to our
proper size again?" I inquired carefully, for I
remembered from previous experience that Shin
Shira's magical powers had an unfortunate habit
of going wrong at times.</p>

<p>"Without the least doubt," replied he; "in
fact, from the time that you are reduced to the
size which you desire to be, you very gradually
increase, till your original size is reached."</p>

<p>"Then there's no danger?" I hazarded.</p>

<p>"None whatever," was the reassuring reply.</p>

<p>"Then do, <i>do</i> please let us be 'reduced,'"
pleaded Lionel eagerly.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said I. "And do you propose
that we should go for a trip in the model
yacht?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" declared Lionel.</p>

<p>"Put it in the water then," said Shin Shira,
"and I'll see what I can do."</p>

<p>Lionel quickly put down the boat, and
stood watching Shin Shira to see what would
happen.</p>

<p>The little Yellow Dwarf was busily gathering
pebbles from the edge of the pond, examining
each carefully, and then throwing them down
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 69]<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>again in what appeared to be an aimless and
unintelligible manner.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he said, "There's <i>one</i>,"
and putting a stone carefully away in his belt,
he continued to search till he had found another
like it.</p>

<p>"And there's the other," he said, coming
towards us.</p>

<p>"Now then, all you have to do is to swallow
these two little white stones and wish to be&mdash;let's
see&mdash;an inch and a quarter high, and there
you are."</p>

<p>"It seems rather a venturesome proceeding,"
I said, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Oh no! it'll be all right! Come along!
Let's swallow them!" cried Lionel, suiting the
action to the word and popping one of the stones
into his mouth without further ado.</p>

<p>He immediately became so small that I had
some difficulty in seeing him at all amongst the
stones at the edge of the Pond.</p>

<p>"Are you not going to swallow one of the stones
too?" I inquired of the Dwarf before swallowing
mine.</p>

<p>"No, I think not," was the reply. "I'll
remain as I am, I think, in case you may require
assistance of a kind which only a larger person
than yourself could afford."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 70]<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>I then swallowed my stone, and immediately
became almost as tiny as my small cousin, having,
for my part, wished to be reduced to the height
of an inch and a half, thinking that <i>some</i> sort
of distinction ought to be preserved in our relative
sizes.</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed Lionel in a vexed voice,
when I had joined him. "It's no use after
all! How on earth are we going to get on
board?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Shin Shira, laughing good-humouredly
and now looking, to us, like a good-natured
giant, towering as he did high above our
heads. "<i>Now</i> you see the wisdom of my having
remained as I am. I can simply lift you on board
and push the boat off for you too."</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, he very gently
and carefully picked up first Lionel and then me
from the ground and placed us on board the yacht,
then gave the boat a little shove which, though he
didn't intend it to do so, sent us both sprawling
on the deck and the boat itself well out into the
water.</p>

<p>I think I have mentioned that a slight breeze
had sprung up, and the Pond was rippled over
with tiny waves, upon which our yacht danced
merrily, the sails having filled out with wind
which drove her along at a fine rate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 71]<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>Lionel was running all over the deck examining
everything eagerly.</p>

<p>"I wish there was a real cabin," he said; "this
is only a dummy one, and I find a lot of the ropes
to the sails won't act properly. I wonder how
you steer the thing, too."</p>

<p>"By means of the rudder, I should imagine,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Of course!" exclaimed Lionel impatiently;
"any baby would know that; but this one is
fastened up so tightly that I can't move it."</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," said I, "it is evidently
set in the right direction; for see, we are heading
straight across the Pond, and there's Shin Shira
walking round to be there to meet us when we
go ashore," and I settled myself down comfortably
to enjoy the pleasant trip.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Look at that!" cried Lionel a
moment or two later, pointing to the shore.</p>

<p>The lame duck had been disturbed by Shin
Shira's passing, and was slowly waddling towards
the water.</p>

<p>"She's coming in!" declared Lionel. "By
Jove! doesn't she look a size now we're so tiny!"</p>

<p>The boy was right, for, to us, the duck now
appeared a formidable monster of strange and
uncouth shape. Her bill, as she came quacking
into the water, opened and shut in an alarming
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 72]<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>manner, revealing the fact that, if she desired to
do so, she could make a meal of us at one gulp.</p>

<p>Somewhat to our dismay, she seemed impelled
by some vague curiosity to swim in our direction,
and the situation began to get distinctly alarming
as she drew nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>"What on earth shall we do?" exclaimed
Lionel. "I hope to goodness she isn't going to
attack us. It would be too silly to be swallowed
by a duck."</p>

<p>"I fancy she's only coming to have a look at us,"
I said, "and at any rate, if we shouted at her
loudly if she came too near it would probably
frighten her away."</p>

<p>This seemed to be the only thing to do, and as
the duck continued to swim directly towards us
we both began to shout and wave our arms about
in what must have appeared to Shin Shira a
perfectly mad fashion.</p>

<p>The noise, however, seemed to have the desired
effect, for the duck paused, looked at us in a
puzzled manner for a moment, and then turned
tail and began moistening her bill in the water,
lifting her head and shaking it after each mouthful,
as their habit is.</p>

<p>"I wish she'd get out of the way," said Lionel
anxiously. "We shall run into her directly,
she's right in our course," and he began to
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 73]<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>shout vigorously again, in the hope of startling
her.</p>

<p>I added my voice to his, and we both yelled our
loudest, with not the slightest effect, however, for
the duck continued unconcernedly to enjoy herself
in her own fashion in the middle of the lake.
Presently what Lionel had feared came to
pass, and with a bump which sent us both off our
feet, the yacht was driven straight on to the duck,
which gave a terrific "Quack!" and swam off
in a hurry.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./images/illus-073.png" width="450" height="318"
title="The yacht was driven straight on to the duck"
alt="Illustration: The yacht was driven straight on to the duck" /></div>

<p>"Our bowsprit's broken," announced Lionel,
directly he had recovered his feet, "and it's
fallen in the water and is dragging the sails
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 74]<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>with it&mdash;and&mdash;look out!" This as a gust of
wind filled the mainsail and caused the boat to
careen over on to her side in a highly dangerous
manner.</p>

<p>"Look out!" and this time another and a
stronger gust completed the matter, and the sail
touched the water and immediately became
saturated, so that the boat could not right
itself.</p>

<p>"Well, we shan't sink, that's one thing," I
said, for Lionel was looking at me in an alarmed
manner. "The water cannot get into the hull,
thanks to there not being a 'real' cabin and the
hatches only being sham ones."</p>

<p>"That's all very well," said Lionel, though giving
a little sigh of relief at my reassuring words,
"but we can't stop here for ever. I should like
to know how we are to get ashore."</p>

<p>Shin Shira, who had seen our accident, was
shouting and gesticulating at the edge of the Pond,
but the wind was blowing in his direction and
carried the sound of his voice away from us, so
that we couldn't hear a single word of what he was
saying.</p>

<p>"I suppose eventually we shall drift ashore,"
I said hopefully.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not for hours and hours perhaps,"
said Lionel dolefully, "because the wind may
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 75]<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>change, you know, and besides it's getting
dusk."</p>

<p>"It certainly isn't a very pleasant look-out,"
I agreed. "I can't see what we are to do, unless&mdash;I
say! what's that big box floating towards
us?"</p>

<p>Lionel looked in the direction in which I was
pointing.</p>

<p>"It's an empty match-box," he said uninterestedly;
"that's no good."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure about that," said I. "Try
and get hold of it as it drifts this way. I've an
idea."</p>

<p>"I can't see what good an empty match-box
can be to us," grumbled Lionel, doing his best,
however, to aid me in capturing the prize as it
blew against the side of the overturned yacht,
which we at last did with some difficulty.</p>

<p>It was a very large box and had evidently been
in the water for some time; the paper around it
had become unstuck from the sides and hung
loose in the water beside it.</p>

<p>"We must get the paper at all cost, and pray
be careful not to tear it," I cried.</p>

<p>"Whatever for?" asked Lionel in amazement.</p>

<p>"Do as you're told and don't ask questions,"
I replied rather crossly, for I was very anxious to
try an experiment which I had in my mind. So
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 76]<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>we hauled the paper aboard and stretched it on
the bulwarks to dry.</p>

<p>Then we hauled the broken bowsprit aboard
and freed it from the broken ropes with our pen-knives&mdash;a
long and difficult job&mdash;and by the
time we had finished, the paper which had been
around the box had become dry and quite stiff
by reason of the gum with which it had been
stuck to the sides of the box.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!" cried Lionel, as I clambered on
to the box (which was fastened by a rope to the
side of the yacht) and began to cut a hole in the
middle. "You're going to make a raft."</p>

<p>"I'm going to try to," I answered grimly, for
I wasn't at all sure that my experiment would
be a success.</p>

<p>By dint of real hard work, cutting and contriving,
however, we did eventually succeed in
making a raft of a sort, the stiff paper, fixed to
the broken bowsprit, making a capital sail;
and somewhat in fear and trembling, we both
got aboard and pushed off from the derelict
yacht.</p>

<p>All went well for some time till we were nearing
the shore, and then I noticed something which
caused me grave alarm.</p>

<p>We were both growing rapidly! The raft,
which had before been quite large enough to
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 77]<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>support us, was now low down in the water with
our weight, and there was great danger of the
water getting into the inside of the box, in which
case it would undoubtedly sink.</p>

<p>Lionel noticed the difficulty at the same time
as myself, for he gave me a startled glance.</p>

<p>"We're getting bigger," he said. "Do you
think the raft will hold out?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," I replied, "but we're quite
near the water's edge now&mdash;perhaps I could
swim ashore with you."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! I can swim twice that
distance myself, thank you. Why, I beat
Mullings Major hollow in the swimming competition
last term, and he's four years older than me,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Whatever Lionel was going to add was lost,
for at that instant he had to put his boasted
prowess to the test. The box, having filled with
water just as I had feared it would do, sank slowly
down, and we were left in the water.</p>

<p>Fortunately Lionel's boast was not a vain one,
and he reached the shore before I did, laughing
and wringing the water out of his clothes.</p>

<p>"Well, it's good to be on dry land once more
at any rate," he said, as I waded ashore, "isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I agreed, looking about to see if I
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 78]<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>could discover any traces of Shin Shira in the
dusk.</p>

<p>"There he is!" at last cried Lionel, "but his
head has vanished, and there are only his legs
and arms waving about. <i>They</i> won't be much
use to us, and&mdash;by Jove! yes! Look, here comes
that wretched old duck after us. We'll have to
cut," and he gathered up his things and set the
example.</p>

<p>It was quite true; the old duck had evidently
come to the conclusion that we were something
dainty to eat&mdash;in the frog line probably&mdash;and was
waddling towards us as quickly as her game leg
would allow.</p>

<p>Fortunately we were soon able to out-distance
her; and having fixed our latitude by Kensington
Palace, which we could just see in the distance,
we set out for the gate.</p>

<p>To our tiny, but rapidly growing bodies the
distance seemed an interminable one, especially
as darkness was now quickly falling. We could
see the lights in Kensington, but they seemed far,
far away; and to add to our dismay, when at last,
tired and exhausted, we did reach the gate, it
was only to find it closed for the night, and
that during our journey from the Pond we had
grown too big to be able to squeeze through
the railings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 79]<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>We waited a few minutes uncertain what to do,
till presently a cab came in sight, the horse walking
leisurely and the cabby evidently on the look-out
for a fare.</p>

<p>"Cabby! cabby!" I called, and Lionel added
his shrill voice to mine.</p>

<p>The cabman looked about in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Here, by the Park gates!" I yelled, and he
got down from his seat and came over to where
we were standing.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm blowed!" he exclaimed when he
had had a good look at us. "What the Dickens
are you? Kids or dwarfs or what?"</p>

<p>"Never mind what we are, cabby; get us out
of here somehow, and drive us home to Kensington
Square, and I'll give you a sovereign."</p>

<p>"Will you, though?" said the cabby. "Well,
I'm gaun to do it, but the question is&mdash;how?
I'll go and knock up the park keeper."</p>

<p>"No, no, don't do that!" I said hastily.
"He'll want such a lot of explanations, and we're
wet and uncomfortable and anxious to get home.
Do please try and think of some way of getting
us out without having to call him."</p>

<p>Our cabby was a man of resource, for having
considered for a moment, he backed the horse
close against the gate, stood on the top and
lowered the horse's nosebag by means of a long
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 80]<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>rope which he kept by him in case of emergencies,
and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now then, get in there, one at a time, and
I'll soon have you over here."</p>

<p>Lionel got in first, and as the cabby had said,
was easily hauled up and deposited on the top
of the cab.</p>

<p>I followed, and in a very short space of time
we were both inside the cab and rattling home at
a good pace.</p>

<p>I got the cabby to knock at the door, and Mrs.
Putchy, to whom I quickly explained everything,
gave him a sovereign for me. In a very few
minutes Lionel and I were warm and comfortable
each in our respective beds.</p>

<p>In the morning we had both grown to our
original sizes, and the adventure of the day before
was nothing but a memory.</p>

<h3>SHIN SHIRA AND THE DIAMOND</h3>


<p>I was exceedingly surprised a few weeks after
our latest adventure with the little Yellow Dwarf
to receive the following extraordinary letter from
him. It was dated from Baghdad, and bore
two very unusual postage stamps, which Lionel
promptly claimed for his collection.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Kind and obliging Sir," it began, "I am in
great and serious trouble and in danger of my
life, and I appeal to you to come to my assistance
by the first boat. I will explain everything
when we meet, but kindly do not delay, as everything
depends upon your presence here.</p>

<p>"Again beseeching you not to delay,</p>

<p>
"Your miserable and much-afflicted friend,<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Shin Shira Scaramanga Manousa<br />
Yama Hawa.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Inquire for me at the State Prison,
Baghdad."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 82]<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>"Well!" I exclaimed, after perusing this
remarkable epistle, "of all the extraordinary
requests I have ever received this is the strangest.
This man, whom I have only met at the most
half-a-dozen times in my life, expects me to
neglect my work and rush off to Baghdad, of all
places in the world, to his assistance, because he
has got into some trouble which has landed him
in the State Prison there. I always thought
somehow that those uncanny powers which he
possesses would get him into serious difficulties
at some time or another. I'll send him a letter
stating that I cannot go to him." And here I
endeavoured to dismiss Shin Shira and his
affairs from my mind.</p>

<p>I was so worried about the matter, however,
that I couldn't settle to work, so I lit my pipe
and settled myself in my easy-chair to think the
matter out.</p>

<p>Poor little fellow! If he really was in such
desperate straits it seemed very heartless to
leave him to his fate if in any way I could be of
real assistance to him; and, after all, I could work
almost as well while I was away as I could at
home, and the voyage would probably give me
plenty of new ideas for my book. I thought of
all the kind things the little chap had done for
me, and how he had always somehow come to
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 83]<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>the rescue when I had been in difficulties in my
adventures with him; and finally I came to the
conclusion that it would be most ungrateful and
selfish of me if I let anything stand in the way of
my going to my friend's assistance.</p>

<p>I had no sooner made up my mind on this
point than I called a cab and set out at once for
Messrs. Cook's office and booked a passage by the
next steamer.</p>

<p>I will not tell you anything about the somewhat
uninteresting journey either by sea or
land, with the exception that when I at last
stepped ashore in an Oriental port, I found in
the curious costumes and strange surroundings
many things to amuse me and to wonder at.</p>

<p>The entire journey on the whole, however, was
decidedly tedious, and I was very glad to find
myself at last in the ancient city of Baghdad.</p>

<p>I went at once to the British Consul there and
told him my object in coming to the city.</p>

<p>"Shin Shira!" he exclaimed. "Why, there
is scarcely anything talked about in these days
but Shin Shira. He has stolen one of the most
valuable crown jewels, and was caught with it
in his possession. Despite the indisputable
evidence against him, however, he persists in
declaring his innocence, and pleads that, with
the assistance of a friend from London, he can
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 84]<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>prove it conclusively. I suppose, sir, that you
are the friend from London."</p>

<p>I told him that I was, and that I was deeply
grieved to hear of the trouble that Shin Shira
was in, and that I felt convinced that there was
some mistake in the matter which could somehow
or other be cleared up.</p>

<p>"I should be very glad to think so," said the
Consul, shaking his head, "but I fear it is hopeless.
You see, the stone&mdash;an almost priceless
diamond&mdash;was actually found in his possession.
But come, you will be anxious to see your friend
as soon as possible. I will come with you to the
prison and see that you are admitted."</p>

<p>The kind-hearted official called his carriage,
and together we drove through the unfamiliar
narrow streets to the dismal-looking building in
which my poor friend was confined.</p>

<p>A brief consultation with the authorities and
the signing of various papers made me free to
enter the prison, and having thanked the Consul
for his kind offices, I was led away by one of the
officials to a terribly dark dungeon, in which,
crouched in a corner, I found my poor friend
Shin Shira, looking the picture of misery.</p>

<p>His face lit up with a smile of hope, however,
when he saw me, and his whole aspect changed.</p>

<p>"My friend! my deliverer!" he cried, using
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 85]<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>all kinds of extravagant Oriental phrases to
express his delight at seeing me. "Ah! at last
you have come, and I shall be saved! May all
the blessings of Allah be on your head!"</p>

<p>The official withdrew, locking the door carefully
behind him, having first given me to understand
by various signs that he would return for me in
about half-an-hour.</p>

<p>"Well, now," I inquired, when we were alone,
"what is this terrible trouble which has brought
you here? What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" declared Shin Shira solemnly.
"Nothing whatever to merit this punishment.
It is all a horrible mistake. Let me begin at
the beginning. About two months ago, after a
series of my usual adventures, I suddenly
appeared here in Baghdad. Now I have been
acquainted with the city for many, many years&mdash;in
fact, ever since the time of Sinbad the Sailor,
whom I knew quite well, and with whom I was
at one time very friendly. Well, I have many
times appeared here since then, and on each
occasion I have taken a great interest in the place
on account of old associations. I have made
many friends here, too; so when I found myself
here once more I was greatly delighted, and was
making my way to the Bazaar, where I knew I
should be sure to find some acquaintances, when
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 86]<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>greatly to my surprise I saw several passers-by
stop and stare at me curiously and then, whispering
amongst themselves, follow me at some
distance behind.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./images/illus-086.png" width="450" height="496"
title="Two men came and seized me by the arms"
alt="Illustration: two men came and seized me by the arms" /></div>

<p>"It could not be my clothing which was
attracting all this attention, for it was more or less
of the same pattern to which they were accustomed.
I caught sight of myself in a polished
steel mirror in one of the shops in the Bazaar, and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 87]<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>stole a glance at myself, but could see nothing
wrong. What could be the cause? I had not
long to wait, however, before I found out to my
cost what was wrong.</p>

<p>"The crowd following me had increased in
size, and at last two enormous men in uniform
came up and seized me by my arms, and I was
immediately surrounded by a throng of curious
faces.</p>

<p>"'Where did you get that diamond?' demanded
one of my captors, pointing to my turban,
in which, as you know, I always wear the jewel
which the Princess gave me.</p>

<p>"'Oh that! That was given to me many
years ago by a friend&mdash;a Princess&mdash;who has been
dead now for many hundreds of years,' I said.</p>

<p>"'Many hundreds of years? And you say
she was a friend of yours?' exclaimed the man.
'Absurd!'</p>

<p>"'Preposterous!' declared the other. 'Look
here! If you can't give us some more reasonable
explanation than that, we shall take you off at
once to the Chief Magistrate, and charge you
with having stolen it.'</p>

<p>"'But why?' I gasped. 'Why should you
think that I have stolen it?'</p>

<p>"'A diamond of exactly that size and colour
has disappeared from amongst the Crown jewels,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 88]<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>and it strikes me very forcibly that this is the
very one.'</p>

<p>"It was in vain for me to protest. I was taken
before the Magistrate, and experts were called
to examine the jewel.</p>

<p>"They weighed it and examined it carefully
through powerful magnifying glasses, and finally
unanimously agreed that it was indeed the missing
jewel.</p>

<p>"I was closely cross-questioned as to how it
came into my possession, and also as to my
movements during the past six months. My
explanations were considered most unsatisfactory,
and no one would believe me; consequently
I was thrown into prison and condemned
to death. It was only by the most earnest
pleading that I managed to gain time for you to
get here, as I assured them that you would be
able to put everything right, and explain matters
to their entire satisfaction."</p>

<p>"I?" I stammered. "I am very, very sorry
for you, my poor friend, and I would do anything
to help you, but what am I to say or do which
will convince them when you tell me that you
have failed to do so?"</p>

<p>"It is easy&mdash;easy," declared Shin Shira hopefully.
"Now attend carefully to what I say.
I am of course not allowed outside the prison
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 89]<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>walls, and there is no one here whom I would dare
to trust with an important commission.</p>

<p>"Now I want you to go at once to the Bazaar,
and find a man named Mustapha, a dealer in
old curiosities; and, without letting him know
whom it is for, purchase from him a large round
crystal which you will find in his shop. He will
probably want a lot of money for it, but whatever
he asks offer him just half, and you will
find that after a lot of argument he will let
you have it at that. These Oriental shopkeepers
are all like that. And then, having secured
the crystal, hurry back here and the rest will
be easy."</p>

<p>Although I could not in the least see what
Shin Shira wanted the crystal for, I was careful
to execute his commission to the letter.</p>

<p>I found no difficulty in reaching the Bazaar,
and, once there, soon found out Mustapha. I
did not like the look of the man at all.</p>

<p>He was a fawning, obsequious little man, with
shifting eyes which never looked you straight
in the face.</p>

<p>He stood bowing and smiling and rubbing his
hands when I entered the shop and asked to see
the crystal.</p>

<p>"Ah yea&mdash;very fine crystal&mdash;for those who
know how to use it. Very vallyble&mdash;lot money.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 90]<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>You know this? You got?" and he gave
me a searching glance with his little bead-like
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I can pay for it if I want it," I said,
"but what do you call a <i>lot</i> of money? How
much do you want
for it?"</p>


<div class="figleft"><img src="./images/illus-090.png" width="260" height="358"
title="Very fine crystal-for those who know how to use it"
alt="Illustration: Very fine crystal-for those who know how to use it" /></div>

<p>He named a price
which I knew to be
very excessive, and
I shook my head
decidedly.</p>

<p>"No! too much!"
I declared.</p>

<p>"Oh! but see!
Beautiful crystal!"
he argued.</p>

<p>"No," I replied,
"too much! I'll
give you half," and
I began to walk
unconcernedly out
of the shop.</p>

<p>"And you give me little present besides?"
pleaded Mustapha.</p>

<p>"Not a penny," said I.</p>

<p>The man gave a little sigh.</p>

<p>"Oh well, you take him," he said. "Not
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 91]<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>enough money, but Mustapha very poor, must
sell him. I wrap him up for you, see!"</p>

<p>I paid him the money and hurried out of the
shop, for I must confess that I had taken a great
dislike to the little man with his smooth, oily
manner.</p>

<p>However, I had got the crystal, and that was
the main thing.</p>

<p>I hastened back to the prison, and after a long
argument with the authorities, I managed to gain
permission to see the prisoner once more.</p>

<p>I found Shin Shira all eagerness to know if I
had secured the crystal, and when he saw it in
my hand, his joy knew no bounds.</p>

<p>"Now it is all easy," said he, "and I shall soon
be free. This is a Magic Crystal, and by wishing
very hard to see any particular object and gazing
at it steadily for a moment or two, you will see
just what you wish to see reflected in it. Now
I'm just going to wish to&mdash;er&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;o&mdash;o-h!
I'm going to vanish! To think
that I've been here all this time hoping every
day that I should be able to disappear, and now,
just as I was about to get myself free&mdash;I&mdash;good-bye&mdash;!"</p>

<p>And to my horror, the little Yellow Dwarf
suddenly faded away, and I was left alone in the
dungeon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 92]<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>I say to my horror, for what was I to say when
the jailer appeared? How was I to account for
the prisoner's escape? I was just puzzling
about these things when the door opened and the
jailer hurriedly came to tell me the time allowed
for my visit was up.</p>

<p>He saw at once that Shin Shira was not there,
and in a great state of excitement plied me with
questions.</p>

<p>I felt, however, that the best thing to do was to
preserve silence: it would at least gain time; so I
shook my head and pretended not to understand
a word of what he was saying in his broken English.</p>

<p>The man doubly locked the door and hurried
off to inform his superior officers, and I was left
alone once more.</p>

<p>My eyes fell upon the crystal, and I suddenly
thought of what Shin Shira had said. Holding
it carefully in my hands, I wished to see the real
thief who had stolen the crown jewel.</p>

<p>A vague mist spread over the crystal, which
gradually cleared away, and I distinctly saw
revealed the features of&mdash;Mustapha. Then I
wished to see what he had done with the stone,
and after gazing a moment or two longer, I saw
him take it down to a cellar under his shop and
bury it in a tin box under a stone, which he lifted
up from the floor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 93]<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>That was enough for me. When the jailer
and the other officers came hurrying back I was
ready for them.</p>

<p>"Where is the prisoner?" they demanded.</p>

<p>"He has escaped," I replied coolly.</p>

<p>"What!" they exclaimed. "You dare to
admit this, and that you assisted him to do so?
You shall take his place here, and will no doubt
receive the punishment which was intended for
him."</p>

<p>"He is an innocent man," said I calmly, "and
ought never to have been imprisoned. He did
not steal the diamond."</p>

<p>"How can you say that when we found it
upon him? Why, he was actually impudent
enough to go walking about in the street with it
boldly stuck in his turban."</p>

<p>"The stone he was wearing was his own, and
he had every right, to wear it where and how he
liked," I replied steadily.</p>

<p>"His own! Pooh! a likely story. Where is
the missing jewel then? Can you tell me
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, to their great astonishment.</p>

<p>"And the thief?" they questioned eagerly.</p>

<p>"I know who he is too. Take me before the
Magistrate at once, and I will soon restore the
lost jewel."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 94]<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>My assured tone of voice seemed somewhat to
impress the officials, and they left me for a few
moments to consult amongst themselves as to
what was best to be done.</p>

<p>Presently they returned and told me to follow
them.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="./images/illus-094.png" width="600" height="356"
title="A gentleman was seated at a table strewn with papers"
alt="Illustration: A gentleman was seated at a table strewn with papers" /></div>

<p>I found myself conducted to a plainly-furnished
room where a dignified-looking gentleman was
seated at a table strewn with papers. He looked
up at me sharply as we entered the room, and
addressing me in excellent English, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is this extraordinary story I hear about
the escape of the prisoner Shin Shira, and that
you are prepared to inform us of another person
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 95]<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>who has, as you say, the crown jewel in his
possession?"</p>

<p>"It is true," said I, "and if you will allow some
of your officers to accompany me into the Bazaar
I will point out the thief at once, and show you
where he has hidden the stone."</p>

<p>The Magistrate thought for a moment. "I
will come with you myself," he said at last.
"Have ready six men to accompany us," he
commanded; and a few minutes later we were
on our way to Mustapha's shop.</p>

<p>The wretched man gave a start and turned
very pale when he saw us, but endeavouring to
put a bold face upon it, he came bowing and
cringing towards us, smiling and wringing his
hands.</p>

<p>"What an honour to my poor house!" he
exclaimed. "How unworthy am I to receive
such august guests!"</p>

<p>"We've come to see if you have any more
crystals like the one I bought of you to-day,
Mustapha," I said.</p>

<p>"Alas! honoured patron, none!" cried Mustapha
in a relieved voice, thinking that he now
knew the object of our visit.</p>

<p>"Think&mdash;think, Mustapha," said I. "Have
you no piece of clear glass that could be used in
its place?"</p>

<div class='pagenum'>[Pg 96]<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./images/illus-096.png" width="600" height="797"

<div class="caption">"I took up the stone"</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 97]<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
"Alas, none!" he replied, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Look about," said I. "Here in the shop&mdash;and
down in the cellar."</p>

<p>The little man's face turned green.</p>

<p>"The cellar? Noble patron, how should I
find such a thing there?"</p>

<p>"Lead the way and I will try to show you,"
said I; and despite his agonised protests, the
trembling wretch was made to lead us to the
very spot where the jewel was hidden.</p>

<p>I took up the stone and showed the Magistrate
the box in which the diamond was concealed,
while Mustapha grovelled on the ground, pleading
for mercy.</p>

<p>What followed was a matter of course. The
merchant Mustapha was arrested, I was released
and commissioned to let Shin Shira know that if
he applied in person for his jewel it would be
returned to him, and an apology offered for his
unwarranted arrest.</p>

<p>And so I was set free&mdash;a stranger and alone
in Baghdad.</p>

<h2><a name="MYSTERY_NO_VII" id="MYSTERY_NO_VII"></a>MYSTERY NO. VII</h2>

<h3>SHIN SHIRA AND THE ROC</h3>


<p>When I found myself alone in Baghdad after
my extraordinary adventure with the Magic
Crystal, my first intention was to return at once
to England.</p>

<p>I found, however, that it would be impossible
for me to do so for at least four days; so I prepared
to make the best of matters by doing a
little sight-seeing while I was still confined to
the ancient and interesting city.</p>

<p>There were two additional reasons which made
the delay less disagreeable to me.</p>

<p>The first one was that I might possibly happen
to meet Shin Shira again before I departed; and
the other was that, on the second day of my
stay, I saw a printed notice to the effect that,
according to the ancient usage of the country relating
to condemned prisoners, all of Mustapha's
goods were to be immediately sold by public
auction, and the money realised was to be confiscated
by the Crown.</p>

<p>I had noticed a number of very quaint and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 99]<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>curious articles in the shop, and thought that it
would be an excellent opportunity for me to
purchase some souvenirs of my visit, to take
back with me to England.</p>

<p>The sale took place the next day, and I was
able to secure several interesting pieces, which
have a place in my study to this day. In fact,
I was tempted to buy so many things that I
began to fear that I should soon not have enough
money left to take me back again to London;
and I was just about to leave the auction, in
order to be out of the way of temptation, when I
caught sight of the quaintest, most uncanny-looking
brass lamp being offered for sale that
you could possibly imagine.</p>

<p>It was slightly damaged too, and looked very
old, so I hoped that it might be going very cheap.</p>

<p>I was right, and to my great delight it was
knocked down to me for a mere trifle.</p>

<p>Clutching my treasures about me, I hurried
back to my hotel, and spent the whole of the
rest of the day examining and admiring my
purchases.</p>

<p>The lamp, though, pleased me most of all,
although it was so old and battered. It was so
very quaint and uncommon, and so typically
Oriental in design&mdash;in fact, I felt sure there was
not another like it in the world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 100]<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>The time came, however, for packing up, and
I had to get everything ready for the morning,
so that I might be in time for the early train.</p>

<p>I had carefully wrapped up the other things,
and was just taking a last look at the lamp
before putting it into the bag, when, turning
around for no apparent reason, I caught sight
of a yellow turban on the floor.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" I thought, "I suppose I must
have brought this away from the Bazaar, with
my other things, by mistake. What a nuisance!
Now I shall have to take it back again, I suppose,
or&mdash;No! it's Shin Shira's. And here comes
the rest of him!" for I could see a little hazy
yellow figure gradually growing out of nothing.</p>

<p>"Ah! just in time, I see," said the little
fellow, when he had quite appeared. "I did
so hope that I should be able to be visible again
before you left Baghdad. Well, how did you get
on? You've got out of prison, I'm glad to see."</p>

<p>I told him about the crystal, and how I
discovered that it was Mustapha who stole the
diamond.</p>

<p>"Phew!" he whistled when he heard this.
"I felt sure someone had stolen it, but I didn't
think of Mustapha. I never liked the man,
though, personally, and I'm glad he's found out
at last. He has done a lot of harm to many
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 101]<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>people in Baghdad, and he will be rightly punished.
What is to be done with <i>my</i> diamond?" he
inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're to have it back whenever you
like to go for it, and you'll receive an apology at
the same time," said I.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, I'm off to get it first thing
in the morning," said the little fellow gleefully.
"I prize that stone far above its intrinsic value,
for it was given to me by my beautiful Princess,
you know, and I would not lose it for anything.
But, I say! what's that curious-looking old
lamp in your hand? May I look at it?"</p>

<p>I handed it over to him.</p>

<p>"It's just a little thing which took my fancy at
Mustapha's sale, and which I picked up for a
trifle," said I.</p>

<p>"It's very dirty&mdash;wants cleaning badly," declared
Shin Shira. "Why, I believe it's solid
brass, though it looks like rusty iron in its
present neglected state," and he seized a duster
which was lying handy and gave the lamp
several smart rubs.</p>

<p>"Just as I thought," said he, going on
vigorously with the polishing. "Why, it's
splendid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" I exclaimed, sinking into a chair.
"See! see what you've done!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 102]<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>An enormous form was rising from the floor,
and presently stood before us making a deep
salaam.</p>

<p>"W-who are you?" I stammered.</p>

<p>"The Slave of the Lamp, Master," said he.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" I exclaimed, "you don't
mean to say that this is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aladdin's lamp," burst in Shin Shira. "I
thought somehow that it looked familiar. I
knew Aladdin well, and I've often handled this
lamp before."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" I exclaimed, gazing at the
big black giant who stood, with his arms folded,
in dignified silence before us.</p>

<p>"Nothing is impossible in the East," said
Shin Shira, "as you'll quickly find out if you
remain here long. And now&mdash;now that you are
the possessor of Aladdin's lamp&mdash;what are you
going to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know," I stammered. "I must
have time to think."</p>

<p>"I should have diamonds," advised Shin
Shira: "they're so easy to carry and can always
be converted into money. Command him to
bring you a bag full of diamonds of all sizes."</p>

<p>"But, but," I said hesitatingly, as visions of
untold wealth floated before my eyes, "will
he really do it?"</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 103]<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
"Try him and see," said Shin Shira. So I
took the lamp in my hand, and rather nervously
commanded the Slave to bring me a bag of
diamonds.</p>

title="I commanded the Slave to bring me a bag of diamonds"
alt="Illustration: I commanded the Slave to bring me a bag of diamonds" /></div>


<p>The Slave fell to the ground and touched his
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 104]<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>head to the floor, paying me the deepest mark of
respect.</p>

<p>"Alas, Master, that it should be so, but you
ask your slave that which is impossible, unless
you would have me take from the shops that
which is not thine."</p>

<p>"Not for worlds," I interrupted. "But how
is it that you cannot get me the diamonds from
the mines as you used to do for your former
Master Aladdin in the olden days?"</p>

<p>A bitter smile spread over the Slave's face.</p>

<p>"The age, Master, has greatly changed, and
now the mines in Africa, which were known only
to us, are being worked by greedy men with
noisy machinery, and we may not be seen there
under peril of death. This is the will of the
Spirit of the Lamp of whom I am the Slave,
and who also calls you Master, though you will
never see her."</p>

<p>"Oh, well then, that's all knocked on the
head," I said to Shin Shira, who had been listening
attentively. "I'll dismiss the man now, shall
I, and we'll talk over what's best to be done?"</p>

<p>Shin Shira nodded, so I told the Slave I had
no further use for him at the moment, and he
vanished.</p>

<p>I stood looking at my little friend in great
bewilderment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 105]<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>"It is a great power to possess," I said,
regarding the lamp with awe and amazement.
"I hope I shan't do anything foolish with it."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," said Shin Shira crossly. "I
only wish I had your chance. Why, you can
do <i>anything</i> with a power like that. Leave it
to me to think over for to-night, and I'll tell
you the best thing to do in the morning."</p>

<p>"But I'm starting for England the first thing
to-morrow," I objected.</p>

<p>"Oh! you must put that off for the present,"
was the decided reply. "I'll be here about
eleven, and we'll talk over what's best to be done.
Good-night!" and the little fellow held out his
hand and strutted off.</p>

<p>I slept very little that night, as you may
imagine, and all sorts of vague ideas came into
my head as to what I should do with the wonderful
power which had so mysteriously come within
my grasp.</p>

<p>I had arrived at no definite decision as to
what was best to be done, however, by eleven
the next morning, when, punctual to the minute,
Shin Shira, looking very spruce and alert,
knocked at my door.</p>

<p>I noticed with considerable interest that he
wore in his turban the diamond which I had so
often admired, and he saw me looking at it at once.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 106]<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>"Yes," he said, with a series of little nods,
"it was very easy. An hour ago I called on
the Chief Magistrate, and found him full of
apologies and quite convinced that he had made
a grievous mistake. It appears that the original
diamond, which Mustapha stole, when found,
had some of the gold setting still attached to
it, proving beyond doubt that it was the missing
jewel, so that my own was returned to me; and
the Magistrate even insisted on providing a
new aigrette and in having it replaced in my
turban by a skilled person. So here it is,"
and he took off his head-dress and regarded it
with considerable pride. "But now to your
affairs. I am still in favour of the idea of the
diamonds."</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;" I began, when Shin Shira
interrupted me.</p>

<p>"Are you game for a very exciting adventure?"
said he.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know." I hesitated. "I seem to
have had about enough of exciting adventures."</p>

<p>"It will be something to write about," suggested
the Dwarf, "and will undoubtedly make
your fortune."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "what is it? Let's hear."</p>

<p>"Do you remember where Sinbad the Sailor
got <i>his</i> diamonds from?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 107]<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>"Yes, of course!" I replied, for I knew my
<i>Arabian Nights</i> by heart.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Shin Shira. "All you've
got to do is to get the Slave of the Lamp to bring
us the Roc, which I happen to know is still alive;
we can then fasten ourselves to his claws, and he
will fly back to his home with us, and there, as you
know, the ground is strewn with precious stones."</p>

<p>"But why not send the Slave for them?"
I argued.</p>

<p>"He evidently doesn't know where they are,
and it's as well to keep him ignorant on the
subject, in case the lamp passed out of your
power, in which case he might use his knowledge
in favour of his next master. And, besides, the
Roc couldn't carry him there."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't have to," said I. "The Slave
evidently has the power of being able to transport
himself to any place at will."</p>

<p>"But <i>we</i> don't know where to direct him to,"
said Shin Shira impatiently. He was evidently
bent upon carrying out his project, and at last
I somewhat weakly consented to his proposal.</p>

<p>I rubbed the lamp and summoned the Slave,
who appeared promptly as before.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to ask such a difficult thing, but
can you catch the Roc for me and bring it here?"
said I, somewhat apologetically.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 108]<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>"It shall be here, Master, in twenty minutes,"
replied the Slave imperturbably, vanishing again
at a wave from my hand.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure, what I want diamonds
for, when I have such a willing servant," I
grumbled, still rather unwilling to venture upon
what I regarded as an uncanny undertaking.</p>

<p>"He can't provide you with money," said
Shin Shira.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He'd have either to steal it or make it.
If he did the latter it wouldn't be legal, and,
besides, if it was found out, you might be arrested
for circulating unauthorised coin."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, then, let's go on this wild-goose
chase if you're so bent upon it," I said,
seeing that he was determined to have his
way. A few minutes later we heard a great
commotion in the courtyard, and looking from
the balcony we saw my Slave carrying by the
legs an enormous bird, who turned his head
about from side to side, staring stupidly at
everything around him. Shin Shira bustled about
and got ropes and straps, and with the assistance
of the landlord and one or two onlookers, we
were soon harnessed in quite an ingenious
manner to the claws of our strange steed (if one
may call him so).</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Page_108a" id="Page_108a"></a><img src="./images/illus-108a.jpg" width="600" height="841"
alt="Illustration: His pinions were strong and mighty."
title="His pinions were strong and mighty." />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 109]<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
The Slave released him, and the Roc immediately
flew slowly up into the air, violently
shaking his claws now and then in a vain
endeavour to get rid of the unusual weight.
Fortunately, however, the straps and ropes,
which had been fastened over the bird's back
as well, were very strong, and so the worst
thing that happened to us was a thorough
shaking.</p>

<p>This was of no consequence, and when I
realised that I was quite safe, I began actually
to enjoy the strange experience of being carried
through the air, I knew not whither. In this
case, however, the distance was not nearly so
great as one might have expected, for leaving
the city, the great bird soared over a tract of
forest land, above one or two more towns, and
so out into the open desert, in the midst of
which was a range of rocky mountains. His
pinions were strong and mighty, so that he flew
very rapidly, and in a little less than two hours
he had alighted on a kind of tableland, at the
top of one of the mountain peaks, and we were
at our journey's end.</p>

<p>There was no doubt but that we were at the
right place, for the ground was strewn with
stones which, though uncut, sparkled, in the
places where they had been chipped or broken,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 110]<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>with a hundred different brilliant colours and
shades.</p>

<p>Shin Shira drew his knife and quickly cut the
ropes and straps which bound us to the now
struggling bird, and he was soon released from
his uncomfortable burden.</p>

<p>He shook himself once or twice and preened
his great feathers, and then stalked off to where
an enormous nest could be seen in a cleft in the
rocks.</p>

<p>I have no doubt the patient and stupid bird
told his mate in bird language what a very
strange and uncomfortable experience he had
had, and at all events he kept out of our sight
from that moment.</p>

<p>Shin Shira at once busied himself by gathering
some of the largest gems as quickly as possible;
and taking from his pockets some strong linen bags
which he had thoughtfully provided, he handed
two to me and told me to fill them for myself.</p>

<p>This I did, and also put several into my various
pockets. I was just about to say that I thought
we had sufficient, when Shin Shira called my
attention to a balloon hovering just above our
heads.</p>

<p>There were two people in the basket, and they
were peering at us over the edge through glasses.</p>

<p>Presently one of them shouted an order, and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 111]<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>the balloon quickly descended, so that we could
hear the rush of escaping gas as it was being
released.</p>

<p>"Hullo there!" shouted a voice over our
heads, "who are you? We've never before
heard that these mountains were inhabited."</p>

<p>"Neither are they," replied Shin Shira. "We
are geologists from Baghdad, and are taking
home specimens of the rocks and stones."</p>

<p>"Oh, we're going to Baghdad. Can we give
you a lift?" said the voice kindly, and the
balloon descended still further, till at last we
were able to see the two occupants distinctly.</p>

<p>"It's really very kind of you;&mdash;I&mdash;I think
we will accept your offer," said I, while Shin
Shira frowned disapproval.</p>

<p>"Don't go," he whispered, "we can get
some more precious stones if we wait a little
longer."</p>

<p>"But how are we to get back?" I answered.</p>

<p>"The Magic Lamp," said he.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I've left that behind at the hotel,"
I replied.</p>

<p>"In that case," said Shin Shira regretfully,
"there's nothing else to be done, I suppose."</p>

<p>So we thankfully accepted the aeronauts' kind
invitation, and were soon floating comfortably
towards Baghdad.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 112]<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>I must confess that it was far more pleasant
than the outward journey had been.</p>

<p>Before we got to Baghdad, though, Shin Shira
had the misfortune to disappear, much to the
horror of the aeronauts, who thought he had
fallen out of the basket, and who would scarcely
credit my explanation when I told them of Shin
Shira's peculiar misfortune in this respect.</p>

<p>He left the two bags of precious stones behind
him, and they stood beside mine at the bottom
of the basket.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the balloon, being freed from
Shin Shira's weight, rapidly ascended, but presently
there was a terrible escape of gas and
we began to descend again at a great rate.</p>

<p>"Throw out the ballast!" cried one of the
aeronauts, and the other, seeing the four bags
of what he thought were worthless stones, in his
haste and eagerness thrust them overboard.</p>

<p>I was too alarmed at the moment to notice
what he was doing, and it was only when matters
had been put right, by stopping the escape of
gas, that I realised what had happened.</p>

<p>It was useless, however, to cry over spilt
milk, and all my thought now was to get back
to the hotel in safety.</p>

<p>This we eventually did, and my ballooning
friends accepted my invitation to take dinner at
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 113]<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>the hotel with me, so that after my adventure of
the day I had a very pleasant evening. It was
not till the next morning that I discovered that
Aladdin's Lamp had vanished&mdash;had, in fact,
probably been stolen.</p>

<p>There was nothing left to do now but to set
out for England, which I eventually reached;
and on arriving in London, and having the
stones which I had brought back in my pockets
valued, I found that there were many worthless
ones among them, and that the few good ones,
when sold, only realised sufficient to pay the
rather heavy expenses of my journey to and
from Baghdad, with a very little over for
myself to repay me for the loss of my time.</p>

<h2><a name="MYSTERY_NO_VIII" id="MYSTERY_NO_VIII"></a>MYSTERY NO. VIII</h2>

<h3>SHIN SHIRA AND THE MAD BULL</h3>


<p>The Verrinder children were in a state of great
excitement and glee, for we were going to spend
the day at Burnham Beeches.</p>

<p>The plan was to drive over in a wagonette
and have a picnic under the trees in the middle
of the day.</p>

<p>Lionel was amongst the party, and Lady Betty,
a young friend of the Verrinders, so that we were
a merry crowd as we scrambled into the wagonette.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter about your being old," said
Fidge, snuggling up to me and catching hold of
my arm; "you're not like most grown-ups, and
don't mind us larking about a bit."</p>

<p>"I hope not," I said smilingly.</p>

<p>"Besides, he isn't old," chimed in Lady Betty,
"at least not very," she qualified. "He hasn't
even got a beard, and if he wasn't a little bit
grown-up he couldn't afford to take us about,"
she added practically.</p>

<p>"I expect we'll have some jolly decent grub,"
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 115]<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>I heard Dick whisper to Lionel. "Mrs. Putchy
makes ripping pastry. I know, because we
used to stay at his place sometimes before you
came."</p>

<p>Marjorie looked up from her book and smiled
and nodded across at me. "It's lovely," she
said, as we drove along. "We're going to have
a perfectly splendid day."</p>

<p>We were sitting three aside, and there was just
comfortable room for us; and when we had got
well into the country I began to tell the younger
ones, Fidge and Lady Betty, a story. Marjorie
closed her book too and leaned forward to listen,
but the two big boys, evidently considering it
<i>infra dig</i>. to listen to anything so childish, were
eagerly comparing school experiences. Dick was
at Harrow and Lionel at Marlborough, so they
had a lot to talk about.</p>

<p>Presently, in the middle of my story, Marjorie
called out, without looking up, "Move further
along, Dick, don't crowd so."</p>

<p>"I'm not!" retorted Dick, "it's you. I
can't move any further without crowding Lionel
out of the trap."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's this cushion," cried Marjorie, turning
about and trying to remove what looked at first
like a yellow silk cushion beside her.</p>

<p>It was evidently too heavy though, and she
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 116]<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>gave a start as she touched it. "Why!" she
exclaimed, "it's got something alive in it!"</p>

<p>We all turned around to see what she meant,
and at once I knew that it was Shin Shira
appearing.</p>

<p>"Oh, jolly!" cried all the children but Lionel,
when I explained to them what was happening.</p>

<p>"It's all very well, and he's good fun and all
that," said my young cousin, "but if you'd had
the experience that I had with his old Magic
Carpet, you'd be very careful not to have much
to do with him&mdash;he's rather dangerous."</p>

<p>"But think of the adventures you have with
him," said Dick enviously. "I wouldn't funk
it if he asked me to go anywhere with him."</p>

<p>"Who's funking it?" demanded Lionel
angrily.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>you</i> didn't seem to have much desire
to repeat your experiences, my friend," laughed
Shin Shira. "My head and ears just happened
to arrive in time for me to gather that."</p>

<p>Lionel turned very red. "Oh well, sir, I did
have rather a rough time on the Magic Carpet,
you know."</p>

<p>"So you did, so you did," agreed Shin Shira,
amiably beaming on us all. "And where
may all you young people be off to this fine
day?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 117]<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>"We're having a picnic," said Lady Betty
shyly.</p>

<p>"Going to have, you mean," corrected Fidge.
"It isn't a picnic till you begin to eat, you know."</p>

<p>"Would you mind if I joined you?" asked the
Yellow Dwarf, appealing to me.</p>

<p>"Well, it strikes me that you have done so,"
I laughed; "but we shall be delighted with your
company if you care to stay."</p>

<p>"That's all right then," said Shin Shira,
settling down comfortably; "there's nothing I
should like better this warm day," and he took
off his turban and rubbed his little bald head with
a yellow silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>The sight of the jewel in it reminded him to
ask me what became of the two bags of diamonds
he left in the basket of the balloon when he
disappeared on our way back to Baghdad.</p>

<p>I told him what had happened, and how I had
lost all of mine except the few almost worthless
ones which I had put in my pocket.</p>

<p>"I was rather more fortunate," said Shin
Shira, "for amongst those which I saved were
one or two very valuable ones, and several more
which I can sell at a very good price when it
becomes necessary."</p>

<p>"But I thought you could have whatever you
wished for?" said Dick.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 118]<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>"Oh no," replied the Dwarf, "not money, you
know&mdash;almost anything else, but not money,
because, you see, it wouldn't be legal to make
money, and I can tell you I have often found it
very awkward to have appeared in a strange
place with no money at all in my pocket. I have
indeed once or twice almost been tempted to sell
even the jewel which the Princess gave me.
Now fortunately that will never be necessary."</p>

<p>"What part of Burnham Beeches do you wish
me to drive to, sir?" asked the coachman at this
moment; "we're just coming to the village."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'd better put the horses up at the
stables, and get a man to help you with the
hampers, and we'll walk on to the wood. You
know where I generally have luncheon."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir!" said the man, touching his
hat with his whip and stopping at the old-fashioned
inn in the village.</p>

<p>We were all very glad to stretch our legs after
the long ride, and having had some lemonade and
fruit at a little shop in the High Street, we quite
enjoyed the walk up to the wood.</p>

<p>Here under the trees in a beautiful spot we
sat down to wait for the men with the hampers.</p>

<p>After waiting for some time with growing
impatience, our coachman turned up with a rueful
face.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 119]<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>"There ain't no hamper, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"What?" I exclaimed. "No hamper! What
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"There ain't no hamper in the trap, sir. I
didn't have it up in front, so I thought you had
it in with you. Do you think it's fallen out,
sir?"</p>

<p>"By Jove, sir!" cried Lionel suddenly, "it's
my fault. You told me to see that the man put
the hampers on in front, and I clean forgot all
about it."</p>

<p>If it hadn't been such a serious matter it would
have been highly amusing to watch the blank
dismay depicted on every face on hearing this
disastrous news.</p>

<p>"What on earth are we to do?" exclaimed
Dick, with almost tragic concern.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing to be done, I suppose,"
said I resignedly, after sending the man away;
"we shall have to return to the village and have
our luncheon at the inn."</p>

<p>"It won't be a picnic at all then," pouted Lady
Betty ruefully.</p>

<p>Shin Shira was the only one who did not seem
distressed about the matter. He had seated
himself cross-legged on the ground under one
of the old Beeches, and was slowly turning over
the leaves of the little yellow book fastened to his
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 120]<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>belt with a golden chain, which he always
wore.</p>

<p>"I think I can be of some assistance to you
here," said he, getting up after a time and coming
towards me. "Has anybody some paper and a
pencil?"</p>


<div class="figleft"><img src="./images/illus-120.png" width="280" height="377"
title="Slowly turning over the leaves of the little yellow book."
alt="Illustration: Slowly turning over the leaves of the little yellow book" />
</div>

<p>This seemed a
strange request at
such a moment,
but between us we
managed to find
what he asked for.</p>

<p>The Dwarf suddenly
tore the
paper into seven
parts, handing us
each one and keeping
one for himself.</p>

<p>"Now," said he,
"each of you write
on the piece of
paper the name of
something you would wish for luncheon."</p>

<p>He handed me the pencil first, and just for
fun I wrote "Lobster salad."</p>

<p>Marjorie wrote "Game pie."</p>

<p>Dick thought that "Pies and tarts and plenty
of them" was a suitable thing to ask for.</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 121]<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>
Lionel could imagine nothing more to be
desired than "Ham and tongue sandwiches."</p>

<p>Lady Betty wanted "Fruit and nuts," and
Fidge, after various painful attempts, wrote
"Something nice to drink."</p>

<p>Shin Shira read them out one by one.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "they're all very well, but
how are you going to eat them when you have
got them? Now you see what I wish for," and
he carefully wrote on his slip of paper, "Tablecloth,
serviettes, plates, dishes, knives, forks,
spoons, salt, pepper, mustard, oil, vinegar, glasses
and a corkscrew." "There!" he exclaimed,
"I think that will put us right. Now watch
carefully. You see there is no deception!"
and he laughingly rolled up his sleeves like a
professional conjurer.</p>

<p>He placed the paper upon which he had written
his list into his turban, shaking it violently.</p>

<p>To our surprise, in a few seconds it sounded as
though there was something in it, and an instant
later he drew forth from it a neatly folded snow-white
tablecloth, the serviettes, spoons, forks,
and in fact all the articles which he had
named.</p>

<p>He set the children to work laying the cloth,
while he placed the other lists in his turban, and
in turn, beginning with a deliciously fresh-looking
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 122]<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>lobster salad, and a large game pie, he brought
forth every one of the good things which had
been wished for.</p>

<p>Fidge's "something nice to drink" turned out
to be bottles of lemonade, milk, soda water, and
a bottle of wine for the grown-ups.</p>

<p>A more delicious feast it would be impossible
to imagine.</p>

<p>We were just sitting down to enjoy it, and I
had stuck the knife and fork into the game pie,
when Marjorie sprang up with a little scream,
brushing something from her face.</p>

<p>"Ough! a horrid caterpillar!" she cried.</p>

<p>"And here's another!" declared Fidge,
knocking one from his coat.</p>

<p>"And an earwig!" exclaimed Dick, picking
one up from the cloth.</p>

<p>"Oh! and spiders!" screamed Lady Betty,
jumping up and shaking her frock.</p>

<p>"Dear! dear! this will never do!" I said,
for the place was swarming with insects, owing to
the very dry summer which we had had.</p>

<p>"There ought to be a marquee like we had at
the choir treat," said Fidge.</p>

<p>"Oh, I vote we get on with the grub," said
Dick greedily. "The insects won't kill us."</p>

<p>"No, but a marquee would certainly be more
comfortable," said Shin Shira. "Come into
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 123]<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>the meadow just over there, and I'll see if I can
provide one."</p>

<p>Leaving Lionel to guard our feast, the rest of
us all trailed after him, over the fence into the
meadow, which was carpeted with soft long
grass.</p>

<p>"The only thing is, I can't exactly remember
what a marquee is like," he said. "Think, my
dear boy, what the one was like which you had
in your mind."</p>

<p>"Why, it had four poles, one at each corner,"
said Fidge, "and some iron things connecting
them at the top, and it was covered all over and
round the sides with some stripey stuff. Then
there were ropes and things, and pegs driven
into the ground to tie the poles to, and a trestle
table and two long forms each side. That's all.
Oh, yes, and Piggott &amp; Son, Tentmakers, was
written in big letters on the stripey stuff."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Shin Shira, "I think I shall be
able to imagine it sufficiently well now. I'll
try," and after consulting his little yellow book
again for instructions, he called for a stick, which
the boys soon cut from the hedge, and marked out
a large square space in the meadow; and then,
using some magic words, he waved the stick
three times, and there stood the very marquee
which Fidge had described, even to the words
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 124]<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>Piggott &amp; Son, Tentmakers, on the canvas
covering.</p>

<p>"Now go and bring the luncheon, children,
and we'll try again," said Shin Shira, in a rare
good humour with himself (the little fellow
was evidently delighted to find that his fairy
powers were acting so well to-day); and soon we
were seated around the table, which, I must
confess, I found a more comfortable way of
enjoying my luncheon.</p>

<p>To say that we did full justice to the good
things provided, is but mildly describing the way
the food disappeared.</p>

<p>The two elder boys in particular seemed as
though they would never leave off, but at last
we settled down comfortably to the fruit and nuts,
and were just discussing what we should do
with the marquee and its contents, when we
suddenly all started to our feet in alarm.</p>

<p>A loud bellowing, combined with a dull sound
of galloping hoofs, told us that something was
coming our way.</p>

<p>I rushed to the door and looked out.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! A mad bull!" I cried,
"tearing this way at a furious pace."</p>

<p>Shin Shira sprang to the opening.</p>

<p>"I'll attract him in another direction, and
while he is after me you all escape over the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 125]<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>fence," he cried hurriedly, and snatching a red
silk handkerchief from Lionel's pocket, he rushed
out into the open.</p>

<p>The bull paused, and though I frantically
shouted to Shin Shira to come back, the brave
little fellow flourished the red handkerchief to
attract the creature's attention. With a bellow
of anger the infuriated animal, holding his head
down, tore after the Dwarf, who ran with surprising
swiftness in the opposite direction to the
marquee.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./images/illus-125.png" width="590" height="323"
title="The Dwarf ran with surprising swiftness in the opposite direction"
alt="The Dwarf ran with surprising swiftness in the opposite direction" /></div>
<p>"Now children, quickly!" I cried, catching
Lady Betty by the hand, and we all made for
the fence as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>We were no sooner in safety than we turned to
see how our gallant little friend was faring.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 126]<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>The yellow figure, still waving the red handkerchief,
was running ahead of the bull, but
to our great distress we could see that the beast
was gaining on him.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! he'll never reach the other side in
time," cried Marjorie, hiding her eyes in her
hands and sinking to the ground in a panic of
fear and fright.</p>

<p>Presently the boys gave an excited shout&mdash;"Hurrah!
Bravo!" they cried, jumping from the
fence and skipping about, tossing their caps into
the air in an excess of relief. I sat down beside
Marjorie and explained to her what had happened.</p>

<p>The bull was rapidly gaining on Shin Shira
and the little fellow was becoming exhausted,
when, by a happy chance, at that very moment
he began to disappear, and before the bull could
reach him he had vanished altogether.</p>

<p>The bull was rushing frantically about, bellowing
and snorting and looking in vain for him, and
at last, turning his attention to the marquee, he
dashed into it, ripping up the canvas and overturning
the table, smashing the dishes, and
altogether making a most terrific commotion.</p>

<p>Now that we were all safe we could make light
of the loss of the marquee and its contents, and
could even smile at the quaint remark of Lady
Betty when she said solemnly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 127]<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>"In future I shall prefer to picnic where there
are spiders, instead of where mad bulls are about.
In fact, I shall rather like spiders after this:
they're so gentle and don't bellow at all."</p>

<p>The boys were still watching the havoc which
the bull was creating, when they noticed a man
walking towards us beside the fence.</p>

<p>He was a big, burly farmer and looked very
angry.</p>

<p>"Now then," he cried, in a surly voice, "what
do you mean by all this?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," I answered.</p>

<p>"I speak plain English, don't I?" he said.
"Wasn't it you that's been trampling in my long
grass, and building tents and what not on private
property? I'll learn you that I won't have no
strangers in my meadows, I can tell ye."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry if I've done any harm," said
I, "and I'm sure if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>If</i> you've done any harm!" shouted the
farmer. "Look at all that long grass trampled
down all over the meadow."</p>

<p>"Yes," I interrupted, "but it was your bull
which did that."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't have done it if you hadn't
teased him," said the farmer obstinately. "I
saw one of you myself teasing him with a red
rag and making him furious. I'm not going to
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 128]<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>have any of it. Off you come with me to the
police station."</p>

<p>"No, no, I can't do that," I cried in alarm;
"I have these children with me."</p>

<p>"People shouldn't take children out if they
can't do without getting into mischief," grumbled
the farmer. "No, you come along of me," and
he caught hold of my arm.</p>

<p>"I'll give you my card," I said, "and if you
have any serious complaint to make you can
write to me."</p>

<p>"Aye, a likely story; and when I write to you,
as likely as not I'll find you've given me a wrong
address."</p>

<p>"Come back with me then to the inn: they
know me there and will tell you whether or no
the address is a correct one."</p>

<p>The old farmer was gradually persuaded to this
course, though he grumbled all the way there that
I ought to be "locked up," while the children,
thoroughly subdued, walked in silence behind
us.</p>

<p>"You'll have to pay a pretty penny for
damages," said he warningly, when he had
satisfied himself at the inn that I was known as
"a gentleman who often drove over there in the
summer, and always paid for what he had."</p>

<p>I assured him that he should have what was
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 129]<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>just, and when he had gone I ordered tea in the
arbour at the end of the old-fashioned garden,
and over it we forgot the unfortunate, but
exciting, termination to our picnic.</p>

<p>We arrived home quite safely. Sure enough,
a few days afterwards I received a preposterous
claim for damage to the farmer's grass,
which I left my solicitor to deal with; and more
extraordinary still, I had a claim from Messrs.
Piggott &amp; Son for damages to a tent, which they
"could not trace as having been hired to me, but
which I must have hired at some time or another,
since it bore their name marked as they only
marked their tents let out on hire."</p>

<p>This letter also went to my solicitor, and to this
day I've heard nothing further about either
matter.</p>

<h2><a name="MYSTERY_NO_IX" id="MYSTERY_NO_IX"></a>MYSTERY NO. IX</h2>

<h3>SHIN SHIRA AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS</h3>


<p>It was many months after this last adventure
before I saw my friend Shin Shira again.</p>

<p>The summer was past, and it was the time of
fires and warm drawn curtains. One evening,
after dinner, I was sitting alone in my study,
puzzling over a chess problem, when the servant
brought me a card on which I read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dr. Shin Shira Scaramanga Manousa Yama
Hawa.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>"Oh!" I laughed, "show him in at once,
please." For I had been longing for an opportunity
of thanking the gallant little fellow for the
bravery he had shown in the matter of the mad
bull&mdash;a bravery to which some of us, at all events,
probably owed our lives.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in! Delighted to see you!"
I cried, getting up and making him comfortable
in "the Toad," the chair which I know he likes
best. I got out the tobacco jar, and we were
soon chatting comfortably over our pipes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 131]<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>"By the way," I said, picking up his card
again and looking at it, when we had exhausted
most of the topics of conversation which came
to our minds, "I didn't know before that you
were a doctor."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't practise, and I seldom use the
title except on my cards. It was given to me
by the King of Hearts very many years ago.
Ha-ha-ha!" And Shin Shira laughed heartily
at what was evidently a humorous recollection.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me about it, please?" said I.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the Dwarf, "that
there is much to tell.</p>

<p>"It was while I was travelling round the world
in my earlier days, and I had come, in the course
of my wanderings, upon the country ruled over
by the King of Hearts and his most charming
Queen.</p>

<p>"Talk about turtle-doves! I had never seen
such a perfectly devoted couple before in my life.
They were like a pair of happy lovers, although
they must have been married several years before
I knew them.</p>

<p>"I happened to appear at their Majesties'
dinner-table one evening when they were dining
alone, just as dinner was being served.</p>

<p>"Of course they were greatly astonished at
seeing me suddenly appear in their presence,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 132]<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>especially as I arrived at a particularly awkward
moment, when, the servants being busy with the
dishes and having their backs turned, the King
was squeezing her Majesty's hand under the
table, and looking lovingly into her eyes.</p>

<p>"The King turned to the Lord Chief Butler,
when that official returned, and looking at me
curiously, said, 'It's very thoughtless of me,
but I do not remember that I invited any guests
for this evening.'</p>

<p>"'I had heard nothing of it either, your
Majesty,' said the Lord Chief Butler, pursing
up his lips and looking at me severely. 'Shall
I request the Lord High Footman and the Lord
Under Footman to remove the person?'</p>

<p>"'By no means,' said the King kindly; 'I
will ask him myself what brings him here.'</p>

<p>"'It was a matter of compulsion, rather than
of inclination, your Majesty,' said I. And I
explained as well as I was able the curious affliction
from which I suffer, of having to appear and
disappear at the fairies' pleasure.</p>

<p>"'Most interesting&mdash;most!' said the Queen,
smiling sweetly, 'and we should be most inhospitable
if we did not make you welcome here
for so long as the fairies will spare you to us.'</p>

<p>"This gracious speech, and the Queen's beauty,
quite won my heart, and putting my hand on my
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 133]<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>heart, I bowed in the most graceful manner that
I could command.</p>

<p>"The Lord Chief Butler, seeing that I was in
favour with their Majesties, now brought me a
plate, and some glasses, and waited upon me
most obsequiously.</p>

<p>"'Tarts, my lord!' he announced, handing
me a silver dish on which were piled some rather
stodgy-looking jam affairs.</p>

<p>"'No thank you,' I replied.</p>

<p>"The man looked horrified, and the King and
Queen greatly embarrassed by my refusal. 'Er&mdash;tarts&mdash;er&mdash;your
Highness,&mdash;er&mdash;her Majesty's
own make,' whispered the Lord Chief Butler.</p>

<p>"'Oh, then by all means I will change my
mind,' said I gallantly, and I took two of the
tarts on my plate, while the King and Queen
looked on approvingly.</p>

<p>"I can safely say that in all my wanderings,
through all these years, I have never before or
since tasted such exceedingly unpleasant tarts.</p>

<p>"I hesitate to say more, out of respect to the
most beautiful and gracious Queen who ever
lived, but I could say a great deal.</p>

<p>"However, I managed to get through them,
even to the bitter end, and had the satisfaction
of seeing her Majesty look greatly delighted.</p>

<p>"'I really must have another one, my love,'
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 134]<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>declared the King; 'they are most delicious,
made as they were by your own royal and beautiful
hands.'</p>

<p>"'No&mdash;no&mdash;dearest,' smiled the Queen, her
pride in her pastry battling with her consideration
for her husband's health, 'you have already
had two.'</p>

<p>"'Perhaps, my darling, you are right,' replied
the King, with a sigh of relief, and hurriedly
motioning to the Lord Chief Butler to remove
his plate.</p>

<p>"'Perhaps our guest, though&mdash;' began the
Queen sweetly.</p>

<p>"'No&mdash;no&mdash;thank you, your Majesty,' I
hastened to say. 'I never&mdash;<i>never</i>&mdash;by any chance
indulge in more than two, under doctor's strict
orders.'</p>

<p>"'Very well then,' said her Majesty, 'we
will have dessert.'</p>

<p>"The rest of the dinner was uneventful, and
I was more and more impressed as the time went
on with the gracious and simple bearing of the
exalted personages of whom I was an uninvited
guest.</p>

<p>"At last her Majesty rose, gave me a bow,
and was led with old-fashioned courtesy by his
Majesty to the door, which was thrown open by
the servants, and the King and I were left alone to
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 135]<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span>our coffee and cigars. After we had talked on
various subjects for some time, I ventured to
express my admiration of, and devotion to, the
gracious lady who had just left us, and the King's
eyes sparkled with delight.</p>

<p>"'You may well admire her, sir; she is rightly
beloved for her graciousness and beauty from
one end of my kingdom to the other, and her
thoughtfulness and kindness to myself are beyond
expression.</p>

<p>"'I <i>must</i> tell you of a little incident (which you
have just shared in) to prove to you how wholly
devoted she is to my interests.</p>

<p>"'I have, as many other royal personages have
at times, some difficulty in regulating my affairs
so as to make both ends meet comfortably.</p>

<p>"'Her Majesty knew of this, and immediately
began to take cooking lessons with a view to
cooking for us when we are alone, and thus saving
expenses in the kitchen. The tarts you tasted
to-day are her Majesty's first attempt.'</p>

<p>"'R-eally!' I murmured, seeing that the King
paused as though he expected me to say something.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' continued his Majesty, 'and to-morrow
she has made me promise to catch
her some blackbirds, with which to make a
pie.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 136]<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>"'Catch them?' I cried; 'why not shoot
them?'</p>

<p>"'Oh! the Queen wouldn't think of letting
me do anything so cruel, she is <i>so</i> tender-hearted.
But you'll come with me to-morrow, and help
me to catch some, won't you?'</p>

<p>"I assured his Majesty that unless I had
unfortunately to disappear before then, I should
be delighted, and we went up to join her Majesty
in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"We found the Queen surrounded by her
Maids of Honour, of whom some were sitting at
the tambour frames, others doing fine embroidery,
while two of their number were at the piano
playing and singing.</p>

<p>"I was presented to these ladies, and, at the
Queen's request, related some of the extraordinary
adventures which, as you know, have, at
one time or another in my long career, befallen
me. The evening was quite a success, and I felt
that I had indeed fallen upon my feet in such
charming company.</p>

<p>"At a moderately early hour we retired, and
in the morning, soon after breakfast, his Majesty
and I started on our expedition in quest of blackbirds
for the Queen's pie.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty and the Maids of Honour
watched us start off from the balcony, and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 137]<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>several retainers followed at a respectful distance,
carrying various bags and implements of
which I could not even imagine the uses.</p>

<p>"When we had got some distance from the
Castle, his Majesty whispered to me confidentially
that he must confess that he didn't know much
about this sort of thing.</p>

<p>"'Er&mdash;do you recommend&mdash;er&mdash;<i>salt</i> for blackbirds?'
he inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>"'What for?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'To put on their tails, you know,' said the
King. 'I have a recollection of hearing something,
somewhere, about catching birds by putting
salt on their tails. But perhaps that doesn't
refer to blackbirds?' he added.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help smiling a little at the simple,
good-natured, inexperienced King, but suggested
immediately afterwards that some grain
scattered before and inside a sieve propped up
with a stick, to which some string was attached,
would probably be a more effectual way of catching
the birds.</p>

<p>"'What a brilliant idea!' said the King. 'I'll
send the salt back and order some sieves, grain,
sticks and string, as you suggest. Is there
anything else?'</p>

<p>"'Something to put the birds in if we catch
any, your Majesty,' said I.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 138]<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>"'Oh! I've thought of that,' said the King,
'and have several baskets ready.'</p>

<p>"The men were soon back with the sieves, and
I quickly rigged up two of them as traps; and
having baited them, I showed the King how to
hide and pull the string directly one of the birds
was under the sieve.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, blackbirds seemed to abound in
that country, and there were soon several fluttering
about, pecking at and picking up the grain.</p>

<p>"Presently, one got under my sieve, and
pulling the support away by the string, I was
fortunate enough to catch it. The King was
delighted, and the more so when a few minutes
afterwards he trapped two at once, in the same
manner.</p>

<p>"After this, the 'sport,' if it could be called so,
became fast and furious, and ended in our catching
four-and-twenty birds between us.</p>

<p>"This the King considered would be sufficient,
so we set off to the Castle again, the men bearing
the baskets in triumph before us.</p>

<p>"'Oh! the dear, sweet little things!' cried
Her Majesty, when she was shown our captives,
'and how clever of you to have caught them all!
They'll make a perfectly lovely pie!' And she
set off in high glee to the kitchens, to try her
hand at the culinary art again.</p>

title="This was carefully set before the King." /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 139]<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>"The afternoon was spent in the beautiful
gardens surrounding the Castle, playing fives,
for which there was a specially built court, and
practising at archery, so that the time quickly
passed, till we were called in by the first dinner
gong.</p>

<p>"The Maids of Honour, together with some of
the State Ministers, joined us at dinner, and I
could see that the Queen, though sweet and
gracious as ever, was very anxious as the dinner
proceeded.</p>

<p>"Presently there was a flourish of trumpets
heard at the door, and two pages appeared, bearing
a silver salver upon which was an enormous
pie. This was carefully set before the King, and
his Majesty, after smiling at the Queen rather
nervously, put the knife into the crust and removed
a portion of it.</p>

<p>"Immediately afterwards, there was a great
commotion heard from inside the pie, and first
one bird and then another began to sing, hopping
out of the pie and on to the table, evidently
delighted at regaining its liberty.</p>

<p>"Finally, amid the breathless silence of all
about the table, they flew off through the open
window, and nothing was left but the crust.</p>

<p>"The Queen sat back in her chair looking
half-triumphant and half-ashamed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 140]<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>"'I'm afraid it isn't a very satisfactory pie,
from the eating point of view,' she faltered,
'but I <i>couldn't</i> have the poor pretty little things
killed, and so I put them in the dish alive, and
when the crust, which I baked separately, was
nearly cold, I cut a hole in the top, so that they
could breathe, and put it over them.'</p>

<p>"'It does your heart much credit, my love,'
cried the King, 'and, the thought of cutting a
hole in the crust was a very kind one.'</p>

<p>"And indeed, wherever and in whatever
country I have been since that time, many years
ago, and have related the story, the ladies of that
country have always made a hole in the top of
their pies, in honour of the beautiful and kind
Queen who first invented it.</p>

<p>"I did not hear much more of the conversation
which followed this episode, for unfortunately,
just then, I felt myself disappearing,
and had only just time to incline my head respectfully
to the King and Queen before I had
vanished."</p>

<p>"But," I remarked, when Shin Shira left off
speaking, "you haven't told me yet how you
came to get the title of 'Doctor.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all part of the same story," said
Shin Shira, refilling his pipe; "it has a sequel.
About seven months after the events which I
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 141]<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>have narrated" (you'll have noticed that Shin
Shira loved using long words when he could), "I
found myself again in the same country, and I
thought I could not leave it without paying
my respects to the
amiable King and
Queen; so, one
fine afternoon, I
made my way up
to the Castle.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="./images/illus-141.png" width="311" height="450"
title="I found the King in his counting-house"
alt="I found the King in his counting-house" /></div>
<p>"I found the
King in his counting-house,
industriously
counting
out his money. He
left off when he saw
me, though, and
came forward to
greet me heartily.</p>

<p>"'The Queen,
bless her! will be
as delighted to see
you as I am,' said
he; 'we'll go and find her. I fancy I know
where she is.'</p>

<p>"He led the way at once to the parlour,
and there we found her Majesty looking sweet
and amiable as ever.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 142]<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>"She was rather confused at being discovered
in the act of eating some bread and honey.</p>

<p>"'I am suffering from a very poor appetite,'
her Majesty explained, after she had made me
welcome, 'and have eaten nothing at all to-day,
and just now I fancied a little honey, for which
I have a great liking.'</p>

<p>"'I hope your Majesty is not unwell, that your
appetite is so feeble?' I inquired with great
solicitation.</p>

<p>"'Oh no!' replied the Queen, with an effort
at brightness; 'I'm a little worried, that's
all.'</p>

<p>"'We're all worried, more or less,' chimed in
the King. '<i>You</i> remember that blackbird pie,
don't you?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, your Majesty, of course I do,' said I,
smiling at the recollection.</p>

<p>"'Well, those birds, the ones which were put
into it, have become very spiteful and dangerous.
They have taken to haunting the precincts of the
Castle, and attack the servants when they go
into the garden, particularly the laundry maids;
for, when they go into the garden to hang out
the clothes, they have to use both hands to do
so, and then these wretched birds fly down and
peck at their noses. One poor creature lost hers
altogether, with the result that all of the maids
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 143]<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>have given notice, and we can't get laundry
maids for love or money.'</p>

<p>"'It's very trying,' said the Queen; 'the poor
King has to wear his things much longer than he
should, and I have a difficulty in even getting a
clean pocket-handkerchief.'</p>

<p>"It was a curious difficulty to be in, certainly,
and I felt very anxious to help them if I could,
so I asked permission to be allowed to visit the
servants' hall, and talk to the maids on the
subject.</p>

<p>"This was readily given, and I spoke to them
as earnestly as I could about their good Queen
and mistress, and how willing and eager they
ought to be to do everything they could for
her.</p>

<p>"I could see that they felt this keenly themselves,
for some of them were in tears when I
spoke of the Queen's goodness to everybody
about her.</p>

<p>"'B&mdash;but our precious noses, sir!' sobbed one
good-natured girl; 'we can't afford to lose them,
can we now?'</p>

<p>"'No,' I said, 'but I have thought of a way
by which it will be quite safe for you to go into
the garden.</p>

<p>"'Now, like good creatures, the first thing in the
morning, set to and get some laundry work done,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 144]<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>and I'll go out and hang up some of the clothes,
and you'll see that the birds won't hurt me.'</p>

<p>"They all agreed to this, and the good-natured
girl who had been crying said, 'I'll come with
you, if you like, and show you how to hang the
things up.'</p>

<p>"'So you shall,' said I, and went up to my
room to make preparations for the morning.</p>

<p>"It was quite simple. I sent for some coloured
wax, and having made a wooden model of a
nose, I made on it some little waxen cases which
could be worn over one's own nose, and <i>then</i>, if the
birds pecked at it, it wouldn't matter in the least.</p>

<p>"In the morning, the wax cases were quite set
and hard, and when the maid and I went out to
hang up the clothes, it was great fun to see the
bewilderment of a large blackbird when he flew
away with the maid's false nose, and she calmly
stuck on another.</p>

<p>"The birds soon gave up their evil ways after
that, but for some months, as a precaution, the
maids never ventured out without a nose protector.</p>

<p>"It was for this useful invention that the King
of Hearts bestowed on me the title of 'Doctor
to His Majesty's Household.'"</p>

<p>"H'm!" I remarked, when he had finished,
"it's a very remarkable story. I seem to have
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 145]<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>heard of some of the incidents before, somehow."</p>

<p>"Very likely, very likely," said Shin Shira
"Well, I must be going now." And he shook
hands and went out by the door, in a sensible
way for once.</p>

<p>As he went out of the house, I heard him singing
softly&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts</span><br />
<span class="i2">All on a summer's day"&mdash;</span>
</div>

<p>And then he changed his song to&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">"Sing a song of sixpence,</span><br />
  <span class="i2">A pocketful of rye,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">Four-and-twenty blackbirds</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Baked in a pie.</span><br />
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">The maid was in the garden</span><br />
  <span class="i2">Hanging out the clothes,</span><br />
  <span class="i0">And along came a blackbird</span><br />
  <span class="i2">And nipped off her nose."</span><br />
 </div>
</div>

<p>And I remembered then why his story had
seemed so familiar.</p>

<h2><a name="MYSTERY_NO_X_AND_LAST" id="MYSTERY_NO_X_AND_LAST"></a>MYSTERY NO. X AND LAST</h2>

<h3>SHIN SHIRA DISAPPEARS</h3>


<p>The day after my little friend had related to
me his experiences in the land of the King and
Queen of Hearts, I was surprised to receive a
portmanteau addressed to me, which, on my
opening it, I found to contain the little yellow
costume, including the turban with the diamond
ornament, which Shin Shira had always worn.</p>

<p>There was no note enclosed, and I naturally
wondered very much what had occasioned this
strange parcel being sent to me.</p>

<p>I had no means of communicating with Shin
Shira, and so had to wait with what patience I
could summon for an explanation from him.</p>

<p>I had not long to wait, fortunately, for in the
afternoon of the same day the little fellow burst
in upon me, clothed in a frock coat, tall hat and
regulation costume of a gentleman in easy
circumstances.</p>

<p>I must say he was not nearly such a picturesque
looking person as he had been in his Oriental
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 147]<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>dress. He threw himself into a chair and seemed
overflowing with news.</p>

<p>"I've decided to settle down," he said breathlessly.
"I didn't tell you yesterday because
my arrangements were not quite completed,
but I've begun now, and I'm going to settle
down."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you mean?" I inquired, utterly
bewildered by my friend's abrupt statement.</p>

<p>"Why," he began, "I'm tired of this constant
changing from one place to another; and as I've
not had to disappear now for some time, I've
come to the conclusion that the fairies have
overlooked the misdeeds of my ancestors and
are going to give me a rest. I've taken a house
in the highly respectable neighbourhood of Russell
Square, and I've furnished it by means of my
fairy powers with everything that is necessary;
besides this, I've realised the full value of all my
precious stones, except, of course, that which
the dear Princess gave me, and have opened a
banking account. There!" and the little fellow
sat back, evidently feeling quite exhausted by
his long speech and vainly searching for his little
fan, which, of course, was not there.</p>

<p>I scarcely knew what to say to this surprising
statement, and waited for further developments
before replying.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 148]<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>"I've engaged a housekeeper to look after me,
and two servants also; and&mdash;as you see&mdash;have
discarded my Oriental costume for one more
suitable to this country and climate; I sent you
my old costume and turban by a trustworthy
messenger this morning, having changed at my
tailor's into the attire in which you see me. I
hope it has arrived safely?"</p>

<p>I assured him that it had, and sent for the
portmanteau in order that he might see for
himself.</p>

<p>"That's all right, then," he said with a sigh
of relief; "and now I want to hand you this
blank cheque which I have signed, and, in case
I disappear, I want you to draw out the whole
amount standing to my account at the bank at
the time, so that I may be able to get it in case
I appear again. I have an idea that I shall
not have to undergo these changes many more
times. Of course, if I never come back, the
money will be yours, as I have no one else to
leave it to."</p>

<p>I thanked him very heartily for the trust he
reposed in me, and assured him that his wishes
should be carried out to the letter.</p>

<p>"That's all right, then!" he exclaimed in a
tone of satisfaction; "and now I want to arrange
for a nice little party at my new home to act as a
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 149]<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>kind of&mdash;er&mdash;home warming&mdash;I think you call it.
Ask the children and any of your friends who
know me, and, if you let me know beforehand
how many are coming, I will arrange for what, I
hope, will turn out to be a very enjoyable
evening."</p>

<p>We fixed the date, and after my little friend
had gone, I wrote informally, as Shin Shira
wished, to as many of my friends as would be
likely to wish to come, to ask them to attend.</p>

<p>Nearly everybody accepted&mdash;for the little
fellow was a great favourite with everybody who
knew him&mdash;and, as Shin Shira looked in every
day to know how the replies were coming
in, I was able to tell him in a few days that
we might expect from twenty to twenty-five
guests.</p>

<p>From then till the date fixed Shin Shira was
very busy, and I only saw him once or twice,
and on the eventful day I did not see him
at all.</p>

<p>The Verrinder children were coming in the
carriage with me, and, according to arrangement,
we were the first to arrive.</p>

<p>There was an awning at the door and a red
carpet laid down the steps and across the pavement;
the house was brilliantly lighted, and
evidently grand preparations had been going on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 150]<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>I hurried up the steps, followed by Marjorie,
Dick and Fidge.</p>

<p>The servant who stood at the open door, and
who knew me by sight, was looking very anxious,
and whispered, "The housekeeper would like to
speak to you at once in the dining-room, sir."</p>

<p>"Anything the matter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, the master&mdash;he&mdash;he can't be found,"
said the man.</p>

<p>I hurried down to the dining-room, and found
the housekeeper in her best black silk dress,
looking even more distressed than the manservant
had been.</p>

<p>"The master, sir," she began at once when I
entered the room. "Whatever <i>is</i> to be done?
He can't be found anywhere&mdash;and the guests
beginning to arrive&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind," said I, after thinking a moment.
"I've no doubt he'll be here presently&mdash;and, in
the meantime, as I know most if not all of the
guests, I'll receive them, and explain that he has
probably been called away and will no doubt be
back presently."</p>

<p>I hurried up into the drawing-room, and found
that by this time several guests had arrived, and
were looking greatly surprised at finding no host
to receive them.</p>

<p>I apologised for my friend as well as I was able,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 151]<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>and pointed out that probably he would soon
return, and, in the meantime, he would doubtless
wish us to make ourselves at home.</p>

<p>We found everything arranged for our comfort.
Professional singers gave an excellent concert
in the drawing-room&mdash;an excellent supper was
served downstairs.</p>

<p>The children were not forgotten, and, while the
concert had been proceeding in the drawing-room,
an amusing entertainment was provided
for them in another room. Beside each plate
at supper, also, there was a little present,
chosen carefully, and our names written distinctly
on each.</p>

<p>Everything was thoroughly well thought out
and provided for&mdash;but&mdash;there was no host to
receive our thanks and to bid us "good-bye"
when we went.</p>

<p>The whole affair, therefore, though I naturally
did my best for my friend's sake to "keep things
going," concluded rather flatly, and I went home
after it was all over feeling not a little depressed
and anxious.</p>

<p>I called the next day, and the day after, but
Shin Shira had not returned, nor had anything
been heard of, or from him.</p>

<p>It was most mysterious, and I could only
account for it by the fact that the fairies may
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 152]<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a></span>have, in fact <i>must</i> have, caused him to disappear
once more.</p>

<p>The housekeeper told me, on my inquiring of
her, that he had been at home the whole of the
day on which the party had been held, superintending
all the arrangements, and had gone up
early to his room to dress, and from that time all
trace of him had been lost.</p>

<p>I was very sorry, and the more so as days and
weeks flew by and nothing happened to give us
any clue as to his whereabouts.</p>

<p>After a couple of months, I told the servants
that they had better seek other situations, and
when they had done so I let them go. I closed
the house, and waited for events.</p>

<p>It must have been quite a year later when I
received the following letter&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div style="margin-left: 70%">"<i>Isle of San Sosta</i>, </div>
<div style="margin-left: 76%">"<i> South Pacific.</i></div>
<p>
<span class="smcap">"My dear Friend,</span><br />
"I write once more to let you know
that I am again in great trouble, but this time
there is nothing in which you can help me,
though I know, in the goodness of your heart,
you would wish to do so if it were possible.</p>

<p>"When, in accordance with the fairies' decree,
to which I must always most humbly bow, I was
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 153]<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>called upon to disappear at the very moment
when I was hoping to welcome my guests to my
newly established home, I found myself most
unexpectedly in this place.</p>

<p>"It is an island very little known, and far out
of the beaten track of vessels.</p>

<p>"Once a year, however, a trader calls, bringing
and taking letters and exchanging for the produce
of this place such necessities as we require from
more civilised lands.</p>

<p>"The people of this country are very simple
and of primitive habits, so much so that it is the
custom here if a maiden remains unmarried after
a certain age, and becomes a burden to her
parents, to turn her out of the community, and
leave her to seek food for herself or starve in the
desert.</p>

<p>"This cruel and unnatural law I have constantly
tried to get altered, and the King and
his advisers consent to do so only on one condition,
and that is, that I find a husband for the
only unmarried daughter of the King, who is at
present an outcast in the wilderness, being of
most uncomely appearance and greatly deformed.</p>

<p>"I have been out into the wilderness to see the
poor creature myself. She is indeed in a pitiful
plight, being far from fair to look upon, and
gaunt and thin with exposure and suffering.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 154]<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>"I conversed with her and found her intelligent,
and patient under her great afflictions; in
fact, her sad case so touched my heart that, not
only for her sake, but for the sake of the other
unfortunate maidens who, unless this cruel law
is altered, may have to suffer a fate similar to
hers, I have decided to marry her myself, and
thus rescue her and others who may follow her.</p>

<p>"I think of my sweet Princess and feel that
she would approve&mdash;for never shall I see her dear
face again&mdash;and in making this marriage she
would know I was inclined to it from pity and
not from any untruthfulness to her most dear
memory.</p>

<p>"The stone she gave me I cannot bear to see
any more, and this I ask you to keep <i>until I claim
it again</i>; all my other goods and the money in
the bank I leave to you absolutely.</p>

<p>"I feel that I may never see you again, and
if this be so, accept my hearty and devoted
thanks for all you have done for me. Think of
me sometimes and</p>

<p>
"Believe me to be,<br />
"Your friend always,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Shin Shira Scaramanga Manousa Yama
Hawa.</span>"
</p>
</div>

<p>I sat a long while after I had read this letter,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 155]<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>thinking of all the strange happenings since I
had known my little friend.</p>

<p>I had grown quite to love and respect him, and
when I thought of the noble and chivalrous deed
he intended performing in order to save the poor
creature in that far-off island, I felt that he was
indeed worthy of all admiration.</p>

<p>I got down a map, and tried in vain to find the
island he mentioned. It was not marked in any
of those which I had by me.</p>

<p>Then I found the portmanteau which Shin
Shira had left with me, and looked at the little
yellow costume, which reminded me so much of
my friend.</p>

<p>In lifting it from the bag, something heavy
dropped from between the folds. It was the
Magic Crystal. I held it in my hand, and wished
I could see what Shin Shira was doing at that
moment. The thought had no sooner entered
my head than I gave an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>A mist in which vague figures were moving
filled the crystal, and presently I could see distinctly
a large crowd of people gathered together.
A man and woman stood beneath a canopy&mdash;the
man I soon perceived was Shin Shira himself,
still clothed in the immaculate frock coat and
tall hat in which I had last seen him dressed.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 156]<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>The woman was a poor, deformed thing and
pitifully plain&mdash;her gaudy dress and many jewels
but helped to point the contrast.</p>

<p>Before them stood a priest, and at the side the
King, surrounded by his warriors. It was evidently
the celebration of a wedding, and the
ceremony was over, for the bridegroom led the
bride from under the canopy and knelt with her
before the King, who stretched out his hands as
though he were giving them his blessing&mdash;and
then, to my astonishment, a most marvellous
thing happened. A blaze of light flashed across
the scene, and a beautiful being, who I am
convinced was the Fairy Queen herself, floated
down from the heights above, accompanied by a
crowd of beings nearly as beautiful as herself.
She waved her wand three times, and the bride
became a beautiful Princess, and Shin Shira grew
tall, young and handsome in an instant.</p>

<p>The King and his court gazed in amazement
at the scene, and the Princess fell into Shin Shira's
arms.</p>

<p>The Fairy waved her wand again, and a bright
crown appeared on Shin Shira's head, in which
flashed a single stone of great brilliancy. At the
same instant the jewel vanished from the yellow
turban beside me.</p>

<p>The crystal grew clear as the beautiful scene
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 157]<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>faded away, and that was the last glimpse I ever
had of my little friend.</p>

<p>I often think of him, and I like to imagine, as,
indeed, I believe to be the case, that the fairies
have restored to him his full powers, and that
the bride he had so unselfishly wedded turned
out to be the very Princess to whom he had
been faithful throughout his long life.</p>

<p>It may be so&mdash;if the crystal spoke truly. Who
knows?</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
